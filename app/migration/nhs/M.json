In the centre is the macula \u2013 the part responsible for central and fine-detail vision needed for tasks such as reading.\nIn the early stages, a macular hole can cause blurred and distorted vision. Straight lines may look wavy or bowed, and you may have trouble reading small print.\nAfter a while, you may see a small black patch or a \"missing patch\" in the centre of your vision. You won't feel any pain and the condition doesn't lead to a total loss of sight.\nSurgery is usually needed to repair the hole. This is often successful, but you need to be aware of the possible complications of treatment.

The vast majority of cases have no obvious cause. They most often affect people aged 60 to 80 and are more common in women than men.\nOne possible risk factor is a condition called vitreomacular traction. As you get older, the vitreous jelly in the middle of your eye starts to pull away from the retina and macula at the back of the eye. If some of the vitreous jelly remains attached, it can lead to a macular hole.\nA few cases may be associated with:\n- retinal detachment\u2013 when the retina begins to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients\n- severe injury to the eye\n- being slightlylong-sighted (hyperopic)\n- being veryshort-sighted (myopic)\n- persistentswelling of the central retina (cystoid macular oedema)"}, {"What should I do?": "If you have blurred or distorted vision, or there's a black spot in the centre of your vision, see your GP or optician as soon as possible. You'll probably be referred to a specialist in eye conditions (ophthalmologist).\nIf you do have a macular hole and you don't seek help, your central vision will probably get gradually worse.\nRelatively early treatment (within months) may give a better outcome in terms of improvement in vision.\nSometimes the hole may close and heal by itself, so your ophthalmologist may want to monitor it before recommending treatment."}, {"What is the treatment and how successful is it?": "A macular hole can often be repaired using an operation called a vitrectomy.\nThe operation is successful in closing the hole in around 9 out of 10 people who've had the hole for less than 6 months. If the hole has been present for a year or longer, the success rate will be lower.\nEven if surgery does not close the hole, your vision will usually at least become stable, and you may find you have less vision distortion.\nIn a minority of patients, the hole does not close despite surgery, and the central vision can continue to deteriorate. However, a second operation can still be successful in closing the hole.\nIf a macular hole is caused by vitreomacular traction, it may be possible to treat it with an injection of ocriplasmin, also called Jetrea, into the eye. The injection helps the vitreous jelly inside your eye to separate from the back of the eye and allows the macular hole to close.\nThe injection takes a few seconds and you'll be given local anaesthetic, as eye drops or an injection, so you won't feel any pain. You'll also be given eye drops to dilate your pupil so the ophthalmologist can see the back of your eye.\nAn ocriplasmin injection is usually only available in the early stages \u2013 while the macular hole is less than 400 micrometres wide \u2013 but causing severe symptoms.\nOcriplasmin can cause some mild side effects, which usually go away, such as:\n- temporary discomfort, redness, dryness or itching\n- swelling of your eye or eyelid\n- sensitivity to light\n- flashing lights\n- blurred, distorted vision\n- decrease in vision or blind spots\nA small number of people may develop more severe side effects, such as a noticeable loss of vision, enlargement of the macular hole or retinal detachment. Surgery is usually needed to correct macular hole enlargement or retinal detachment.\nSeek help immediately if you have:\n- severely decreased or distorted vision\n- severe eye pain\n- double vision, headaches, or you are feeling or being sick\nYour vision may be blurry immediately after the injection. You should not drive or use any tools or machines until it's back to normal.\nIf the ocriplasmin injection fails to close the macular hole, vitrectomy surgery may be suggested to close the macular hole and improve the vision."}, {"What does vitrectomy\u00a0surgery involve?": "Macular hole surgery is a form of keyhole surgery performed under a microscope.\nSmall incisions are made in the white of the eye and very fine instruments are inserted.\nFirst, the vitreous jelly is removed (vitrectomy) and then a very delicate layer (the inner limiting membrane) is carefully peeled off the surface of the retina around the hole to release the forces that keep the hole open.\nThe eye is then filled with a temporary gas bubble, which presses the hole flat onto the back of the eye to help it seal.\nThe bubble of gas will block the vision while it's present, but it slowly disappears over a period of about 6 to 8 weeks, depending on the type of gas used.\nMacular hole surgery usually lasts about an hour and can be done while you're awake (under local anaesthetic) or asleep (under general anaesthetic). \nMost patients opt for a local anaesthetic, which involves a numbing injection around the eye, so no pain is felt during the operation."}, {"What can I expect after the operation?": "With the gas in place, the vision in your eye will be very poor \u2013 a bit like having your eye open under water.\nYour balance may be affected and you'll have trouble judging distances, so be aware of steps and kerbs. You may have problems with activities such as pouring liquids or picking up objects.\nIn the 7 to 10 days after the operation, the gas bubble slowly starts to shrink. As this happens, the space that was taken up by the gas fills with the natural fluid made by your eye, and your vision should start to improve.\nIt generally takes 6 to 8 weeks for the gas to be absorbed and vision to improve.\nYour eye may be mildly sore after the operation and will probably feel sensitive.\nContact your ophthalmologist immediately or go to your nearest eye A&E department if at any time:\n- you're in severe pain\n- your vision gets worse than it was on the day after the surgery\nWhen you wake up, your eye will be padded with a protective plastic shield taped over it. The pad and shield can be removed the day after the operation.\nYou may be able to go home the same day, but most patients need to stay in hospital overnight.\nIf you've had a general anaesthetic, you will not be able to leave the hospital unless a responsible adult is there to help you get home.\nYou'll usually be prescribed 2 or 3 types of eye drops to take after surgery:\n- an antibiotic\n- a steroid\n- a drug to control the pressure in your eye\nYou'll be seen again in the clinic about 2 weeks after the operation and, if all is well, the drops will be reduced over the following weeks.\nFor the first few weeks after you return home, you may need to avoid:\n- rubbing your eye \u2013 you may be asked to wear an eyepatch\n- swimming \u2013 to avoid infection from the water\n- strenuous exercise\n- wearing eye make-up"}, {"Do I need to position myself face down after the operation?": "Once at home, you may have to spend several hours during the day with your head held still and in a specific position, called posturing.\nThe aim of lying or sitting face down is to keep the gas bubble in contact with the hole as much as possible, to encourage it to close.\nThere's evidence that lying face down improves the success rate for larger holes, but it may not be needed for smaller holes.\nIf you're asked to do some face-down posturing, your head should be positioned so the tip of your nose points straight down to the ground. This could be done sitting at a table, or lying flat on your stomach on a bed or sofa. Your doctor will advise you on whether you need to do this and, if so, for how long.\nIf face-down posturing isn't advised, you may simply be told to avoid lying on your back for at least 2 weeks after the surgery.\nYou may be advised to avoid sleeping on your back following surgery, to make sure the gas bubble is in contact with the macular hole as much as possible.\nYour ophthalmologist will advise you whether you need to sleep like this and for how long."}, {"Am I able to travel after macular hole surgery?": "You must not fly or travel to high altitude on land while the gas bubble is still in your eye (up to 12 weeks after surgery).\nIf you ignore this, the bubble may expand at altitude, causing very high pressure inside your eye. This will result in severe pain and permanent loss of vision."}, {"What if I need another operation shortly after my treatment?": "If you need a general anaesthetic while the gas is still in your eye, it's vital you tell the anaesthetist so they can avoid certain anaesthetic agents that can cause expansion of the bubble."}, {"Can I drive after the operation?": "You probably won't be able to drive for 6 to 8 weeks after your operation while the gas bubble is still present in your eye. Speak to your specialist if you're unsure.\nYou'll notice the bubble shrinking and will be aware when it has completely gone."}, {"How much time will I need off work?": "Most people will need some time off work, although this will depend to an extent on the type of work you do and the speed of recovery. Discuss this with your surgeon."}, {"What are the possible complications of macular hole surgery?": "It's unlikely you'll suffer harmful effects from a macular hole operation.\nHowever, you should be aware of the following possible complications.\nThe hole may fail to close, but this normally won't have made your vision any worse, and it's usually possible to repeat the surgery.\nYou'll almost certainly get a cataract after the surgery, usually within a year if you've not already had a cataract operation. This means the natural lens in your eye has gone cloudy. If you do already have a cataract, it may be removed at the same time the hole is being repaired.\nRetinal detachment is when the retina detaches from the back of the eye. It happens in around 6%of people having macular hole surgery. This can potentially cause blindness, but it's usually repairable in a further operation.\nBleeding occurs very rarely, but severe bleeding within the eye can result in blindness.\nInfection is also very rare, occurring in an estimated 1 in 1,000 patients. An infection needs further treatment and could lead to blindness.\nAn increase in pressure within the eye is quite common in the days after macular hole surgery, usually due to the expanding gas bubble. In most cases, it's short-lived and controlled with extra eye drops or tablets to reduce the pressure, protecting the eye from damage. If the high pressure is extreme or prolonged, there may be some damage to the optic nerve as a result."}, {"How successful is macular hole surgery?": "The most important factor in predicting whether the hole closes as a result of surgery is the length of time the hole has been present.\nIf you've had a hole for less than 6 months, there's about a 90% chance your operation will be successful \u2013 9 in 10 operations will successfully close the hole.\nIf the hole has been present for a year or longer, the success rate will be lower.\nMost people have some improvement in vision after they've recovered from the surgery. At the very least, the operation usually prevents your sight from getting any worse.\nYour doctor will speak to you in more detail about what results you can expect from the surgery.\nEven if surgery does not successfully correct your central vision, a macular hole never affects your peripheral vision, so you'd never go completely blind from this condition."}, {"Can I develop a macular hole in my other eye?": "After carefully examining your other eye, your surgeon should be able to tell you the risk of developing a macular hole in this eye.\nIn some people this is extremely unlikely, in others there's a 1 in 10 chance of developing a macular hole in the other eye.\nIt's very important to monitor any changes in the vision of your healthy eye and report these to your eye specialist, GP or optician urgently."}, {"How does it differ from\u00a0age-related macular degeneration (AMD)?": "A macular hole is not the same as macular degeneration, although they affect the same area of the eye and can sometimes both be present in the same eye.\nAMD is damage to the macula leading to the gradual loss of central vision.

This might be the case if any of your relatives went through the menopause at a very young age (20s or early 30s).\nRadiotherapy and chemotherapy can cause premature ovarian failure. This may be permanent or temporary.\nYour risk of having an early menopause will depend on:\n- your age \u2013 girls who have not yet reached puberty can tolerate stronger treatment than older women\n- the type of treatment you're given \u2013 different types of chemotherapy may affect the ovaries differently\n- where on your body any radiotherapy is focused \u2013 your risk of developing premature menopause is higher if you have radiotherapy treatment around your brain or pelvis\nSurgically removing both ovaries will also bring on premature or early menopause.\nFor example, the ovaries may need to be removed during a hysterectomy (an operation to remove the womb)."}, {"Symptoms of early menopause": "The main symptom of early menopause is periods becoming infrequent or stopping altogether without any other reason (such as pregnancy).\nSome women may also get other typical menopausal symptoms, including:\n- hot flushes\n- night sweats\n- vaginal drynessand discomfort during sex\n- difficulty sleeping\n- low moodoranxiety\n- reduced sex drive (libido)\n- problems with memory and concentration\nRead more about the symptoms of the menopause.\nWomen who go through early menopause also have an increased risk of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease because of their lowered oestrogen hormone levels."}, {"Diagnosing early menopause": "A GP should be able to make a diagnosis of early menopause based on your symptoms, your family history, and blood tests to check your hormone levels.\nYou may be referred to a specialist."}, {"Treatments for early menopause": "The main treatment for early menopause is either the combined contraceptive pill or HRT to make up for your missing hormones.\nA GP will probably recommend you take this treatment until at least the age of natural menopause (around 51 on average), to give you some protection from osteoporosis and other conditions that can develop after the menopause.\nIf you have had certain types of cancer, such as certain types of breast cancer, you may not be able to have hormonal treatment.\nThe GP will talk to you about other treatment options and lifestyle changes you can make to help protect your health.\nIf you're still getting symptoms, the GP can refer you to a specialist menopause centre.\nRead more about treating the symptoms of the menopause."}, {"Getting support": "Going through the menopause early can be difficult and upsetting.\nPermanent early menopause will affect your ability to have children naturally.\nYou may still be able to have children by using IVF and donated eggs from another woman, or using your own eggs if you had some stored.

Some periods may cause little or no discomfort, while others may be more painful.\nSometimes you may get pelvic pain even when you do not have your period."}, {"Causes of period pain": "Period pain happens when the muscular wall of the womb tightens (contracts). Mild contractions continually occur in your womb, but they're usually so mild that most women cannot feel them.\nDuring your period, the wall of the womb starts to contract more vigorously to help the womb lining shed as part of your period.\nWhen the wall of the womb contracts, it compresses the blood vessels lining your womb. This temporarily cuts off the blood supply \u2013 and oxygen supply \u2013 to your womb. Without oxygen, the tissues in your womb release chemicals that trigger pain.\nWhile your body is releasing these pain-triggering chemicals, it's also producing other chemicals called prostaglandins. These encourage the womb muscles to contract more, further increasing the level of pain.\nIt's not known why some women have more period pain than others. It may be that some women have a build-up of prostaglandins, which means they experience stronger contractions.\nLess commonly, period pain can be caused by an underlying medical condition.\nPeriod pain linked to an underlying medical condition tends to affect older women. Women aged 30 to 45 are most commonly affected.\nMedical conditions that can cause period pain include:\n- endometriosis\u2013 where cells that normally line the womb grow in other places, such as in the fallopian tubes and ovaries; these cells can cause intense pain when they shed\n- fibroids\u2013 non-cancerous tumours that can grow in or around the womb and can make your periods heavy and painful\n- pelvic inflammatory disease\u2013 where your womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries become infected with bacteria, causing them to become severely inflamed\n- adenomyosis \u2013 where the tissue that normally lines the womb starts to grow within the muscular womb wall, making your periods particularly painful\nAn intrauterine device (IUD) is a type of contraception made from copper and plastic that fits inside the womb. It can also sometimes cause period pain, particularly during the first few months after it's inserted.\nYou may notice a change in your normal pattern of pain if your period pain is linked to a medical condition or a contraceptive IUD. For example, the pain may be more severe or it may last much longer than normal.\nYou may also have:\n- irregular periods\n- bleeding in between periods\n- a thick or foul-smellingvaginal discharge\n- pain during sex\nSee a GP if you have any of these symptoms as well as period pain."}, {"How long period pain lasts": "Period pain usually starts when your bleeding begins, although some women have pain several days before the start of their period.\nThe pain usually lasts 48 to 72 hours, although it can last longer. It's usually at its worst when your bleeding is heaviest.\nYoung girls often have period pain when they begin getting periods. Read more about starting periods.\nPeriod pain that does not have an underlying cause tends to improve as a woman gets older. Many women also notice an improvement after they've had children."}, {"Treating period pain": "In most cases period pain is mild enough to treat at home.\nYou can take ibuprofen and aspirin to help manage your pain.\nHowever, do not take ibuprofen or aspirin if you have asthma or stomach, kidney or liver problems. Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 16 years of age.\nYou could also try paracetamol, but studies have shown that it does not reduce pain as well as ibuprofen or aspirin.\nIf ordinary painkillers do not help, your GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as naproxen or codeine.\nYou could also try:\n- stopping smoking \u2013 smoking is thought to increase the risk of period pain\n- exercise \u2013 you may not feel like exercising during a painful period, but being active may reduce pain; try some gentle swimming, walking or cycling\n- heat \u2013 putting a heat pad or hot water bottle (wrapped in a tea towel) on your tummy may help reduce pain\n- warm bath or shower \u2013 taking a warm bath or shower can relieve pain and help you relax\n- massage \u2013 light, circular massage around your lower abdomen may also help reduce pain\n- relaxation techniques \u2013 relaxing activities, such as yoga or pilates, may help distract you from feelings of pain and discomfort\n- transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS)\u2013 a small battery-operated device that delivers a mild electrical current to your tummy to help reduce pain"}, {"When to see a GP": "See a GP if you have severe period pain or your normal pattern of periods changes \u2013 for example, if your periods become heavier than usual or irregular.\nThe GP may want to feel your tummy (abdomen) to check it feels normal.\nIf your symptoms are unusual, the GP may carry out an internal examination, sometimes known as a pelvic examination. This can be helpful in diagnosing or ruling out other causes of your period pain.\nYou may be prescribed the contraceptive pill. It can ease period pain because it thins the womb lining and reduces the amount of prostaglandin your body releases.\nA thinner womb lining means the muscles of the womb do not have to contract as much when it sheds. Your period will also be lighter.\nIf the contraceptive pill is not suitable for you, the contraceptive implant or the contraceptive injection are good alternatives.\nThe Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) can also sometimes help with painful periods.\nIf your period pain has not been controlled after 3 months of treatment with painkillers or a suitable hormonal contraceptive, your GP may refer you to a specialist, which will usually be a gynaecologist.\nThe specialist will carry out further tests to help confirm or rule out an underlying medical condition. Tests you may have include:\n- a urine orblood test\n- pelvic ultrasound\u2013 where high-frequency sound waves are used to produce an image of the inside of your body; it's painless and will show any abnormalities in your reproductive organs\n- laparoscopy\u2013 under general anaesthetic, a small cut is made in your abdomen through which a fibro-optic telescope is inserted; it can be used to look at your internal organs as well as take samples of tissue (abiopsy)\n- hysteroscopy\u2013 allows the inside of the womb to be examined using a fibro-optic telescope; it's passed through your vagina and into the womb to check for abnormalities\nIf your period pain is caused by an underlying medical condition, your treatment will depend on which condition you have.\nFor example, if you have pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), you may need antibiotics to treat the infection, while fibroids may need to be surgically removed."}, {"Period pain and fertility": "Period pain that's part of your normal menstrual cycle will not affect your fertility.

This is inflated inside the narrowed valve to stretch it wider. The balloon is then deflated and removed along with the catheter.\nThis procedure is generally less effective than replacing the mitral valve, but recovery tends to be quicker and it may be a better option if your valve is not too narrow or you're at an increased risk of surgery complications (for example, if you're pregnant or frail)."}]}, {"condition": "Molar pregnancy", "sections": [{"No header": "A molar pregnancy is when there's a problem with a fertilised egg, which means a baby and a placenta do not develop the way they should after conception.

This sends out radio signals, which are picked up by receivers.\nThese signals provide information about the exact location of the protons in the body. \nThey also help to distinguish between the various types of tissue in the body, because the protons in different types of tissue realign at different speeds and produce distinct signals. \nIn the same way that millions of pixels on a computer screen can create complex pictures, the signals from the millions of protons in the body are combined to create a detailed image of the inside of the body."}, {"Safety": "An MRI scan is a painless and safe procedure.
