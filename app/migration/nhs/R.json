In these cases, there's no faulty gene and only 1 eye is affected (unilateral).\nAround 36 children are diagnosed with retinoblastoma in the UK each year."}, {"Diagnosing\u00a0retinoblastoma": "Your GP will carry out a red reflex test in a darkened room using an ophthalmoscope (a magnifying instrument with a light at one end).\nWhen a light is shone into your child's eyes, your GP will see a red reflection if the retina is normal.\nIf the reflection is white, it may be a sign of an eye condition such as cataracts, retinal detachment or retinoblastoma.\nIn this case, your child will be urgently referred (within 2 weeks) to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) for further investigation.\nThe eye specialist will examine your child's eyes, and they may carry out another red reflex test.\nEyedrops will be used to increase the size of your child's pupils, allowing a clear view of the retina at the back of the eye.\nAn ultrasound scan is also sometimes used to help diagnose retinoblastoma.\nThis is a painless procedure where gel is rubbed on the outside of the eyelid and a small ultrasound probe is placed on the eyelid, which scans the eye.\nAfter these investigations, if the eye specialist thinks your child has retinoblastoma they'll refer them to a specialist retinoblastoma treatment centre, either at The Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital.\nYour child's appointment should be within a week of being seen at your local eye clinic.\nAt the specialist centre, your child will need to have a general anaesthetic so their eyes can be thoroughly examined and a diagnosis of retinoblastoma can be confirmed or ruled out."}, {"Treating\u00a0retinoblastoma": "Your child will be treated by a specialist retinoblastoma team at either The Royal London Hospital or Birmingham Children's Hospital.\nBut if your child needs chemotherapy, this will usually be carried out at a local children's cancer centre and overseen by the retinoblastoma team at one of the specialist hospitals.\nThe recommended treatment for retinoblastoma will depend on the stage of the tumour, which can either be:\n- intraocular\u2013 where the cancer is completely within the eye\n- extraocular\u2013 where the cancer spreads beyond the eye to the surrounding tissue, or to another part of the body (this is rare in the UK)\nMost cases of retinoblastoma (9 out of 10) are detected early and successfully treated before the cancer spreads outside the eyeball.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the eye, it'll be more difficult to treat. But this is rare as the condition is usually identified well before it reaches this stage.\nDepending on the size and position of the tumour, your child's specialist will be able to accurately stage the cancer into one of a number of categories (A to E).\nThe American Cancer Society has more information about how retinoblastoma is staged.\nThere are 2 possible treatment options for treating small tumours contained within the eye:\n- laser treatment to the eye (photocoagulation or thermotherapy)\n- freezing the tumour (cryotherapy)\nThe aim of these treatments is to destroy the tumour. They're carried out under general anaesthetic, so your child will be unconscious and will not feel any pain or discomfort during the procedure.\nIn some cases, chemotherapy may be needed before or after these treatments.\nLarger tumours will be treated with 1 or a combination of the following treatments:\n- brachytherapy\u2013 if the tumour is not too large, small radioactive plates called plaques are stitched over the tumour and left in place for a few days to destroy it, before being removed;radiotherapyto the whole eye may be recommended for larger tumours that have not responded to other treatment methods\n- chemotherapy\u2013 may be used to shrink the tumour at the start of treatment, or it may be recommended if there's a chance of the cancer spreading; in some cases, chemotherapy medicine can be delivered directly to the eye\n- surgery to remove the eye\u2013 is often necessary for very large tumours where there's no sight from the eye; if your child needs to have their eye removed, they'll have an artificial eye fitted in its place\nYou can find out more about artificial eyes from the National Artificial Eye Service.\nYour child's treatment team will discuss any possible side effects of treatment with you.

Also, the age at which symptoms first appear varies from child to child.\nA child may not have all the symptoms of Rett syndrome and their symptoms might change as they get older.\nRett syndrome is described in 4 stages, although symptoms will often overlap between each stage. These are the main features of each stage:\nAt first, the child will appear to develop and grow normally for at least 6 months. There may be subtle signs of Rett syndrome before the child is recognised as having a problem (especially with hindsight).\nStage 1 is sometimes described as \"stagnation\". Symptoms include:\n- low muscle tone (hypotonia)\n- difficulty feeding\n- unusual, repetitive hand movements or jerky limb movements\n- delay with development of speech\n- mobility problems, such as problems sitting, crawling and walking\n- lack of interest in toys\nThese symptoms typically begin from 6 to 18 months and often last for several months, although they can persist for a year or more.\nStage 1 can often go unnoticed because the changes occur gradually and may be subtle.\nDuring stage 2, known as \"regression\" or the \"rapid destructive stage\", the child starts to lose some of their abilities. This stage usually begins between the ages of 1 and 4 and may last for any time from 2 months to more than 2 years.\nThe child will gradually or suddenly start to develop severe problems with communication and language, memory, mobility, co-ordination and other brain functions. Some of the characteristics and behaviours are similar to those of autism.\nSigns at this stage include:\n- loss of the ability to use the hands purposefully \u2013 repetitive hand movements are often difficult to control and include wringing, washing, clapping or tapping\n- periods of distress, irritability and sometimes screaming for no obvious reason\n- social withdrawal \u2013 a loss of interest in people and avoidance of eye contact\n- unsteadiness and awkwardness when walking\n- problems sleeping\n- slowing of head growth\n- difficulty eating, chewing or swallowing, and sometimesconstipationthat may causetummy aches\nLater on during regression, the child may experience periods of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) or slow breathing, including breath-holding. They may also swallow air which can lead to abdominal bloating.\nStage 3 of Rett syndrome can begin as early as 2 years or as late as 10 years. It often lasts for many years, with many children remaining in this stage for most of their lives.\nDuring stage 3, some of the stage 2 symptoms may get better \u2013 for example, there may be improvements in behaviour, with less irritability and crying.\nThe child may become more interested in people and their surroundings, and there may be improvements in alertness, attention span and communication. Their walking may also improve (or they may learn to walk, if they could not before).\nOther symptoms at this stage include:\n- seizures, which may become more common\n- irregular breathing patterns may get worse \u2013 for example, shallow breathing followed by rapid, deep breathing, or breath holding\nGaining and maintaining weight can also be difficult to achieve.\nStage 4 can last for years or even decades. The main symptoms at this stage are:\n- development of a spinal curve (the spine bending to the left or right side), known asscoliosis\n- muscle weakness and spasticity (abnormal stiffness, particularly in the legs)\n- losing the ability to walk\nCommunication, language skills and brain function do not tend to get any worse during stage 4. The repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves.\nSeizures also usually become less of a problem during teenage and early adult life, although they will often be a lifelong problem to manage."}, {"What causes Rett syndrome?": "Almost all cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation (a change in the DNA) in the MECP2 gene, which is found on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes).\nThe MECP2 gene contains instructions for producing a particular protein (MeCP2), which is needed for brain development. The gene abnormality prevents nerve cells in the brain from working properly.\nThere's usually no family history of Rett syndrome, which means it is not passed on from one generation to the next. Almost all cases (over 99%) are spontaneous, with the mutation occurring randomly."}, {"Diagnosing\u00a0Rett syndrome": "Rett syndrome is usually diagnosed based on your child's symptoms, and by ruling out other more common disorders.\nA diagnosis of Rett syndrome may not be made for a number of years because the syndrome is so rare and symptoms do not tend to appear until a child is between 6 and 18 months old.\nA genetic blood test can be used to identify if the genetic mutation is responsible for Rett syndrome. If a change is found in the MECP2 gene, it can help confirm the diagnosis, but failing to find it does not necessarily rule out the syndrome.\nRead more about genetic testing."}, {"Managing Rett syndrome": "There's no cure for Rett syndrome, so treatment focuses on managing the symptoms.\nAs a parent caring for a child with the syndrome, it's likely you'll need help and support from a wide range of healthcare professionals.\nYour child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids:\n- speech and language therapy, picture boards, eye gaze technology and other visual aids to help with communication\n- medication for breathing and mobility problems, and anti-epileptic medicine to control seizures\n- physiotherapy, attention to mobility, careful attention to your child's sitting posture (to minimise the chances of scoliosis developing), and frequent changes in posture\n- if scoliosis does become established, a back brace and sometimes spinal surgery may be used to prevent the spine curving further (read more abouttreating scoliosis)\n- a high-calorie diet to help maintain sufficient weight, with the use of a feeding tube and other feeding aids if necessary\n- occupational therapyto help develop the skills needed for dressing, feeding and other daily activities\n- an ankle-foot orthosis (lower leg brace) to help them walk independently\n- a hand splint to help control hand movements, if these are severe (they're mainly used for limited periods to prevent self-injury or to encourage activities with the other hand)\n- beta blockermedicine or apacemakerto control their heart rhythm\nTherapeutic horse riding, swimming, hydrotherapy and music therapy have also been reported to be beneficial.
