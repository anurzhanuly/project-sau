It can be inherited, but there is often no clear reason why it happens.\nThe most common times to find out that a person has a DSD are around the time of their birth or when they're a teenager."}, {"Types\u00a0of DSDs": "There are many different types of DSD. Some examples are:\nSome people have XX (usual female) chromosomes with ovaries and a womb, but their genitals may not look the same as many females.\nFor example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed.\nDoctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD.\nThe most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.\nWithout these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place.\nCAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible.\nFind more information and advice from the CAH support group.\nSome people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may develop in the usual way for girls or boys.\nSometimes it's difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls' or boys'. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly.\nDoctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD.\nMany people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it.\nFor some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes.\nThere are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body \"ignores\" androgens or is insensitive to them.\nSometimes a person's body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens.\nComplete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female.\nFind support and more information about AIS from DSD Families or the AIS Support Group.\nSome people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY).\nTheir internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods.\nDoctors call this sex chromosome DSD.\nOne type is Klinefelter syndrome, which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY).\nThis can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men.\nFind more information and support about Klinefelter syndrome.\nAnother example of this type of DSD is Turner syndrome, which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome.\nGirls and women with Turner syndrome are often infertile and their height may be shorter than average.\nFind support and more information about Turner Syndrome.\nSome females are born with an underdeveloped womb or without a womb, cervix and upper vagina. The ovaries and external genitalia look the same as most girls and women and they develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older.\nThis is called Rokitansky syndrome. It's also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome). The cause is not clear, but girls and women with Rokitansky syndrome/MRKH have XX chromosomes.\nOften the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex involving the vagina may also be difficult because the vagina may be shorter than most women's.\nNot having a womb means that a woman cannot become pregnant, but it's sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman's womb (surrogacy).\nFor support and more information about Rokitansky syndrome at:\n- MRKH UK\n- Living MRKH\n- DSD Families\nSome people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis).

Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body.\nBabies with IVA are unable to fully break down the amino acid leucine.\nNormally, leucine is broken down into a substance called isovaleric acid, which is then converted into energy.

A protein-free baby formula can be given to replace the missing breast or baby milk. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs.\nPeople with IVA need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.\nYour child may be prescribed medicine to help clear some of the excess isovaleric acid. This will be either:\n- L-carnitine\n- glycine\nSometimes, both medicines are prescribed to be taken together. Medicine for IVA needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor. Both of these are taken by mouth.\nIf your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill.\nYour dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medicine should still be taken as normal.\nYour dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill.\nIf your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea, contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you're heading straight to the A&E department. You should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen IVA before.\nOnce in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein).\nYou should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties."}, {"How IVA is inherited": "The genetic change (mutation) responsible for IVA is passed on by the parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.\nA baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 1 from their mother and 1 from their father (known as autosomal recessive inheritance).
