Left untreated, this can cause a number of unpleasant symptoms and eventually be fatal.\nDialysis filters out unwanted substances and fluids from the blood before this happens."}, {"How long will I need dialysis for?": "It depends. In some cases, kidney failure may be a temporary problem and dialysis can be stopped when your kidneys recover.\nBut often, someone with kidney failure will need a kidney transplant.\nIt's not always possible to carry out a kidney transplant straight away, so dialysis may be needed until a suitable donor kidney becomes available.\nIf a kidney transplant is not suitable for you \u2013 for example, because you're not well enough to have a major operation \u2013 dialysis may be needed for the rest of your life."}, {"What happens during\u00a0dialysis": "There are 2 main types of dialysis: haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis.\nHaemodialysis is the most common type of dialysis and the one most people are aware of.\nDuring the procedure, a tube is attached to a needle in your arm. \nBlood passes along the tube and into an external machine that filters it, before it's passed back into the arm along another tube.\nAt dialysis centres, this is usually carried out 3 days a week, with each session lasting around 4 hours.\nIt can also be done at home. Some examples of a home dialysis schedule include:\n- 4 times a week for 4 hours\n- 5 times a week for 3 hours\n- 6 days a week for 8 hours overnight\nPeritoneal dialysis uses the inside lining of your abdomen (the peritoneum) as the filter, rather than a machine.\nLike the kidneys, the peritoneum contains thousands of tiny blood vessels, making it a useful filtering device.\nBefore treatment starts, a cut (incision) is made near your belly button and a thin tube called a catheter is inserted through the incision and into the space inside your abdomen (the peritoneal cavity). This is left in place permanently.\nFluid is pumped into the peritoneal cavity through the catheter. As blood passes through the blood vessels lining the peritoneal cavity, waste products and excess fluid are drawn out of the blood and into the dialysis fluid.\nThe used fluid is drained into a bag a few hours later and replaced with fresh fluid.\nChanging the fluid usually takes about 30 to 40 minutes and normally needs to be repeated around 4 times a day.\nIf you prefer, this can be done by a machine overnight while you sleep.  \nRead more about how dialysis is performed"}, {"Which type of dialysis is best?": "In many cases, you'll be able to choose which type of dialysis you want to have and where to have it.\nThe 2 techniques are equally effective for most people, but each has its own advantages and drawbacks.\nFor example:\n- haemodialysismeans you'll have 4 treatment-free days a week, but the treatment sessions last longer and you may need to visit hospital each time\n- home haemodialysis\u2013 you'll usually need to have dialysis sessions more often than you would in a clinic, but you can choose a treatment plan that meets your medical needs and fits around your life\n- peritoneal dialysiscan be done quite easily at home and can sometimes be done while you sleep, but it needs to be done every day\nIf you're able to choose the type of dialysis you prefer, your care team will discuss the pros and cons of each option with you to help you make a decision.\nRead more about the advantages and disadvantages of both types of dialysis"}, {"Side effects of dialysis": "Haemodialysis can cause itchy skin and muscle cramps.

It means a person's sex development is different to most other people's.\nSometimes the term Disorders of Sex Development is used, as is Variations in Sex Characteristics (VSC) or Diverse Sex Development. Some adults and young people with DSD prefer to use the term intersex.\nYou or your child may have sex chromosomes (bundles of genes) usually associated with being female (XX chromosomes) or usually associated with being male (XY chromosomes), but reproductive organs and genitals that may look different from usual.\nThis happens because of a difference with your genes or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body, or both. It can be inherited, but there is often no clear reason why it happens.\nThe most common times to find out that a person has a DSD are around the time of their birth or when they're a teenager."}, {"Types\u00a0of DSDs": "There are many different types of DSD. Some examples are:\nSome people have XX (usual female) chromosomes with ovaries and a womb, but their genitals may not look the same as many females.\nFor example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed.\nDoctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD.\nThe most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone.\nWithout these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place.\nCAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible.\nFind more information and advice from the CAH support group.\nSome people have XY (male) chromosomes, but their external genitals may develop in the usual way for girls or boys.\nSometimes it's difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls' or boys'. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly.\nDoctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD.\nMany people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it.\nFor some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes.\nThere are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS), where the body \"ignores\" androgens or is insensitive to them.\nSometimes a person's body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens.\nComplete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female.\nFind support and more information about AIS from DSD Families or the AIS Support Group.\nSome people have a chromosome pattern other than the usual XY or XX. They may have one X chromosome (XO), or they may have an extra chromosome (XXY).\nTheir internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods.\nDoctors call this sex chromosome DSD.\nOne type is Klinefelter syndrome, which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY).\nThis can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men.\nFind more information and support about Klinefelter syndrome.\nAnother example of this type of DSD is Turner syndrome, which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome.\nGirls and women with Turner syndrome are often infertile and their height may be shorter than average.\nFind support and more information about Turner Syndrome.\nSome females are born with an underdeveloped womb or without a womb, cervix and upper vagina. The ovaries and external genitalia look the same as most girls and women and they develop breasts and pubic hair as they get older.\nThis is called Rokitansky syndrome. It's also known as Mayer-Rokitansky-K\u00fcster-Hauser (MRKH syndrome). The cause is not clear, but girls and women with Rokitansky syndrome/MRKH have XX chromosomes.\nOften the first sign of Rokitansky syndrome is that a girl does not start having periods. Sex involving the vagina may also be difficult because the vagina may be shorter than most women's.\nNot having a womb means that a woman cannot become pregnant, but it's sometimes possible to take eggs from their ovaries, fertilise them, and implant them in another woman's womb (surrogacy).\nFor support and more information about Rokitansky syndrome at:\n- MRKH UK\n- Living MRKH\n- DSD Families\nSome people with a very rare type of DSD have both ovarian and testicular tissue (sometimes one ovary and one testis).

local water unless you're sure it's clean (sterile) \u2013 drink bottled water or drinks in sealed cans or bottles.\n- If the water is not sterile, boil it for several minutes or use chemical disinfectant or a reliable filter.\n- Do not clean your teeth with tap water.\n- Do not have ice in your drinks because it may be made from unclean water.\n- Avoid fresh fruit or vegetables that cannot be peeled before you eat them.\n- Avoid food and drink sold by street vendors, except drinks in properly sealed cans or bottles.\nRead more about food and water safety abroad."}, {"What causes dysentery?": "Bacillary and amoebic dysentery are both highly infectious and can be passed on if the poo (faeces) of an infected person gets into another person's mouth.\nThis can happen if someone with the infection does not wash their hands after going to the toilet and then touches food, surfaces or another person.\nIn the UK, the infection usually affects groups of people who are in close contact, such as in families, schools and nurseries.\nThere's also a chance of getting the infection through anal or anal oral sex (rimming).\nIn developing countries with poor sanitation, infected poo may contaminate the water supply or food, particularly cold uncooked food."}]}, {"condition": "Dyslexia", "sections": [{"No header": "Dyslexia is a common learning difficulty that mainly causes
