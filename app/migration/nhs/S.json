This is known as chronic sarcoidosis.\nSarcoidosis most often affects the lungs, skin and/or lymph nodes (glands).\nThe lungs are affected in about 90% of people with sarcoidosis. This is known as pulmonary sarcoidosis.\nThe main symptoms are shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. Some people with pulmonary sarcoidosis experience pain and discomfort in their chest, but this is uncommon.\nThe skin is also affected in many people with sarcoidosis.\nThis can cause tender, red bumps or patches to develop on the skin (particularly the shins), as well as rashes on the upper body.\nIf other organs are affected, you may also have some of the following symptoms:\n- tender andswollen glandsin the face, neck, armpits or groin\n- tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell\n- painful joints\n- red or sore eyes\n- anabnormal heart rhythm\n- a blocked or stuffy nose\n- pain in the bones\n- kidney stones\n- headache"}, {"Causes of sarcoidosis": "The body's immune system normally fights off infections by releasing white blood cells into the blood to isolate and destroy the germs. This results in inflammation (swelling and redness) of the body tissues in that area. The immune system responds like this to anything in the blood it does not recognise, and dies down when the infection has been cleared.\nIt's thought that sarcoidosis happens because the immune system has gone into \"overdrive\", where the body starts to attack its own tissues and organs. The resulting inflammation then causes granulomas to develop in the organs.\nThere are many similar conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, that are caused by the body attacking its own tissues. These are collectively known as autoimmune conditions.\nIt's not known why the immune system behaves like this.\nIt's possible that some environmental factor triggers the condition in people who are already genetically susceptible to it.\nSarcoidosis can occasionally occur in more than one family member, but there's no evidence that the condition is inherited. The condition is not infectious, so it cannot be passed from person to person."}, {"Who's affected": "Sarcoidosis can affect people of any age, but usually starts in adults aged between 20 and 40.

A small sample of lung tissue may also be removed during this test so it can be studied under a microscope. This is known as a biopsy.\nIf doctors think you may have sarcoidosis affecting other organs \u2013 such as the skin, heart or eyes \u2013 scans or examinations of these areas will usually be carried out."}, {"How sarcoidosis is treated": "Most people with sarcoidosis do not need treatment as the condition often goes away on its own, usually within a few months or years.\nSimple lifestyle changes and over-the-counter painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen) are often all that's needed to control the pain of any flare-ups.\nDoctors will monitor your condition to check if it's getting any better or worse without treatment. This can be done with regular X-rays, breathing tests and blood tests.\nIf treatment is recommended, steroid tablets are usually used.\nThis helps relieve symptoms and prevent damage to affected organs by reducing inflammation and preventing scarring.\nHowever, steroid tablets can cause unpleasant side effects such as weight gain and mood swings if taken in high doses. Other side effects, such as weakening of the bones (osteoporosis), can also develop if steroids are taken for a long time. Therefore, they're only used when necessary.\nYou may initially be given a high dose of steroid medicine for a short period of time, before switching to a low dose for the months or years that follow. Your condition will be monitored during this time to see how well the treatment is working.\nIn some cases, taking calcium or vitamin D supplements can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis caused by long-term use of steroid medicine. However, you should only take these if advised to by a doctor. Some people with sarcoidosis may have an increased risk of developing complications, including kidney stones, while taking steroid medicine.\nOther medicines may sometimes be used if steroids are not enough or there are concerns about side effects. In these cases, a medicine called an immunosuppressant might be recommended. This may help to improve your symptoms by reducing the activity of your immune system."}, {"Living with sarcoidosis": "SarcoidosisUK recommends the following lifestyle measures if you have sarcoidosis:\n- stop smoking, if you smoke\n- avoid exposure to dust, chemicals, fumes and toxic gases\n- eat a healthy balanced diet\n- drink plenty of water\n- get plenty of exercise and sleep\nFind a SarcoidosisUK support group"}, {"Outlook": "Symptoms of sarcoidosis may come and go, and can usually be managed with over-the-counter painkillers so they do not affect everyday life.

It's often first noticed when the child starts to interact with people outside their family, such as when they begin nursery or school.\nThe main warning sign is the marked contrast in the child's ability to engage with different people, characterised by a sudden stillness and frozen facial expression when they're expected to talk to someone who's outside their comfort zone.\nThey may avoid eye contact and appear:\n- nervous, uneasy or socially awkward\n- rude, disinterested or sulky\n- clingy\n- shy and withdrawn\n- stiff, tense or poorly co-ordinated\n- stubborn or aggressive, having temper tantrums when they get home from school, or getting angry when questioned by parents\nMore confident children with selective mutism can use gestures to communicate \u2013 for example, they may nod for \"yes\" or shake their head for \"no\".\nBut more severely affected children tend to avoid any form of communication \u2013 spoken, written or gestured.\nSome children may manage to respond with a few words, or they may speak in an altered voice, such as a whisper."}, {"What causes selective mutism": "Experts regard selective mutism as a fear (phobia) of talking to certain people. The cause is not always clear, but it's known to be associated with anxiety.\nThe child will usually have a tendency to anxiety and have difficulty taking everyday events in their stride.\nFind out more about anxiety in children.\nMany children become too distressed to speak when separated from their parents and transfer this anxiety to the adults who try to settle them.\nIf they have a speech and language disorder or hearing problem, it can make speaking even more stressful.\nSome children have trouble processing sensory information such as loud noise and jostling from crowds \u2013 a condition known as sensory integration dysfunction.\nThis can make them \"shut down\" and be unable to speak when overwhelmed in a busy environment. Again, their anxiety can transfer to other people in that environment.\nThere's no evidence to suggest that children with selective mutism are more likely to have experienced abuse, neglect or trauma than any other child.\nWhen mutism occurs as a symptom of post-traumatic stress, it follows a very different pattern and the child suddenly stops talking in environments where they previously had no difficulty.\nHowever, this type of speech withdrawal may lead to selective mutism if the triggers are not addressed and the child develops a more general anxiety about communication.\nAnother misconception is that a child with selective mutism is controlling or manipulative, or has autism. There's no relationship between selective mutism and autism, although a child may have both."}, {"Diagnosing selective mutism": "Left untreated, selective mutism can lead to isolation, low self-esteem and social anxiety disorder. It can continue into adolescence and adulthood if not managed.\nA child can successfully overcome selective mutism if it's diagnosed at an early age and appropriately managed. \nIt's important for selective mutism to be recognised early by families and schools so they can work together to reduce a child's anxiety. Staff in early years settings and schools may receive training so they're able to provide appropriate support.\nIf you suspect your child has selective mutism and help is not available, or there are additional concerns \u2013 for example, the child struggles to understand instructions or follow routines \u2013 seek a formal diagnosis from a qualified speech and language therapist.\nYou can contact a speech and language therapy clinic directly or speak to a health visitor or GP, who can refer you. Do not accept the opinion that your child will grow out of it or they are \"just shy\".\nYour GP or local Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) should be able to give you the telephone number of your nearest NHS speech and language therapy service.\nOlder children may also need to see a mental health professional or school educational psychologist. \nThe clinician may initially want to talk to you without your child present, so you can speak freely about any anxieties you have about your child's development or behaviour.\nThey'll want to find out whether there's a history of anxiety disorders in the family, and whether anything is causing distress, such as a disrupted routine or difficulty learning a second language. They'll also look at behavioural characteristics and take a full medical history.\nA person with selective mutism may not be able to speak during their assessment, but the clinician should be prepared for this and be willing to find another way to communicate.\nFor example, they may encourage a child with selective mutism to communicate through their parents, or suggest that older children or adults write down their responses or use a computer.\nIt's possible for adults to overcome selective mutism, although they may continue to experience the psychological and practical effects of spending years without social interaction or not being able to reach their academic or occupational potential.\nAdults will ideally be seen by a mental health professional with access to support from a speech and language therapist or another knowledgeable professional.\nSelective mutism is diagnosed according to specific guidelines. These include observations about the person concerned as outlined:\n- they do not speak in specific situations, such as during school lessons or when they can be overheard in public\n- they can speak normally in situations where they feel comfortable, such as when they're alone with parents at home, or in their empty classroom or bedroom\n- their inability to speak to certain people has lasted for at least 1 month (2 months in a new setting)\n- their inability to speak interferes with their ability to function in that setting\n- their inability to speak is not better explained by another behavioural, mental or communication disorder"}, {"Associated difficulties": "A child with selective mutism will often have other fears and social anxieties, and they may also have additional speech and language difficulties.\nThey're often wary of doing anything that draws attention to them because they think that by doing so, people will expect them to talk.\nFor example, a child may not do their best in class after seeing other children being asked to read out good work, or they may be afraid to change their routine in case this provokes comments or questions. Many have a general fear of making mistakes.\nAccidents and urinary infections may result from being unable to ask to use the toilet and holding on for hours at a time. School-aged children may avoid eating and drinking throughout the day so they do not need to excuse themselves.\nChildren may have difficulty with homework assignments or certain topics because they're unable to ask questions in class.\nTeenagers may not develop independence because they're afraid to leave the house unaccompanied. And adults may lack qualifications because they're unable to participate in college life or subsequent interviews."}, {"Treating selective mutism": "With appropriate handling and treatment, most children are able to overcome selective mutism. But the older they are when the condition is diagnosed, the longer it will take.\nThe effectiveness of treatment will depend on:\n- how long the person has had selective mutism\n- whether or not they have additional communication or learning difficulties or anxieties\n- the co-operation of everyone involved with their education and family life\nTreatment does not focus on the speaking itself, but reducing the anxiety associated with speaking.\nThis starts by removing pressure on the person to speak. They should then gradually progress from relaxing in their school, nursery or social setting, to saying single words and sentences to one person, before eventually being able to speak freely to all people in all settings. \nThe need for individual treatment can be avoided if family and staff in early years settings work together to reduce the child's anxiety by creating a positive environment for them.\nThis means:\n- not letting the child know you're anxious\n- reassuring them that they'll be able to speak when they're ready\n- concentrating on having fun\n- praising all efforts the child makes to join in and interact with others, such as passing and taking toys, nodding and pointing\n- not showing surprise when the child speaks, but responding warmly as you would to any other child\nAs well as these environmental changes, older children may need individual support to overcome their anxiety.\nThe most effective types of treatment are cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) and behavioural therapy.\nCognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) helps a person focus on how they think about themselves, the world and other people, and how their perception of these things affects their thoughts and feelings. CBT also challenges fears and preconceptions through graded exposure.\nCBT is led by mental health professionals and is more appropriate for older children, adolescents \u2013 particularly those experiencing social anxiety disorder \u2013 and adults who've grown up with selective mutism.\nYounger children can also benefit from CBT-based approaches designed to support their general wellbeing.\nFor example, this may include talking about anxiety and understanding how it affects their body and behaviour and learning a range of anxiety management techniques or coping strategies.\nBehavioural therapy is designed to work towards and reinforce desired behaviours while replacing bad habits with good ones.\nRather than examining a person's past or their thoughts, it concentrates on helping combat current difficulties using a gradual step-by-step approach to help conquer fears.\nThere are several techniques based on CBT and behavioural therapy that are useful in treating selective mutism. These can be used at the same time by individuals, family members and school or college staff, possibly under the guidance of a speech and language therapist or psychologist.\nIn graded exposure, situations causing the least anxiety are tackled first. With realistic targets and repeated exposure, the anxiety associated with these situations decreases to a manageable level.\nOlder children and adults are encouraged to work out how much anxiety different situations cause, such as answering the phone or asking a stranger the time.\nIn stimulus fading, the person with selective mutism communicates at ease with someone, such as their parent, when nobody else is present.\nAnother person is introduced into the situation and, once they're included in talking, the parent withdraws. The new person can introduce more people in the same way.\nShaping involves using any technique that enables the person to gradually produce a response that's closer to the desired behaviour.\nFor example, starting with reading aloud, then taking it in turns to read, followed by interactive reading games, structured talking activities and, finally, 2-way conversation.\nPositive and negative reinforcement involves responding favourably to all forms of communication and not inadvertently encouraging avoidance and silence.\nIf the child is under pressure to talk, they'll experience great relief when the moment passes, which will strengthen their belief that talking is a negative experience.\nDesensitisation is a technique that involves reducing the person's sensitivity to other people hearing their voice by sharing voice or video recordings.\nFor example, email or instant messaging could progress to an exchange of voice recordings or voicemail messages, then more direct communication, such as telephone or Skype conversations.\nMedicine is only really appropriate for older children, teenagers and adults whose anxiety has led to depression and other problems.\nMedicine should never be prescribed as an alternative to environmental changes and behavioural approaches. Though some health professionals recommend using a combination of medicine and behavioural therapies in adults with selective mutism.\nHowever, antidepressants may be used alongside a treatment programme to decrease anxiety levels, particularly if previous attempts to engage the individual in treatment have failed."}, {"Advice for parents": "- Do not pressurise or bribe your child to encourage them to speak.\n- Let your child know you understand they're scared to speak and have difficulty speaking at times. Tell them they can take small steps when they feel ready and reassure them that talking will get easier.\n- Do not praise your child publicly for speaking because this can cause embarrassment. Wait until you're alone with them and consider a special treat for their achievement.\n- Reassure your child that non-verbal communication, such as smiling and waving, is fine until they feel better about talking.\n- Do not avoid parties or family visits, but consider what environmental changes are necessary to make the situation more comfortable for your child.\n- Ask friends and relatives to give your child time to warm up at his or her own pace and focus on fun activities rather than getting them to talk.\n- As well as verbal reassurance, give them love, support and patience."}, {"Getting help and support": "Teenagers and adults with selective mutism can find information and support at iSpeak, Finding Our Voices and the Facebook group SM SpaceCafe.\nThe Selective Mutism Information and Research Association (SMiRA) is another good resource for people affected by selective mutism.

Occasionally, they may also be prescribed to treat pain."}, {"How SSRIs work": "It's thought that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin levels in the brain.\nSerotonin is a neurotransmitter (a messenger chemical that carries signals between nerve cells in the brain). It's thought to have a good influence on mood, emotion and sleep.\nAfter carrying a message, serotonin is usually reabsorbed by the nerve cells (known as \"reuptake\"). SSRIs work by blocking (\"inhibiting\") reuptake, meaning more serotonin is available to pass further messages between nearby nerve cells.\nIt would be too simplistic to say that depression and related mental health conditions are caused by low serotonin levels, but a rise in serotonin levels can improve symptoms and make people more responsive to other types of treatment, such as CBT."}, {"Doses and duration of treatment": "SSRIs are usually taken in tablet form. When they're prescribed, you'll start on the lowest possible dose thought necessary to improve your symptoms.\nSSRIs usually need to be taken for 2 to 4 weeks before the benefit is felt. You may experience mild side effects early on, but it's important that you don't stop taking the medicine. These effects will usually wear off quickly.\nIf you take an SSRI for 4 to 6 weeks without feeling any benefit, speak to your GP or mental health specialist. They may recommend increasing your dose or trying an alternative antidepressant.\nA course of treatment usually continues for at least 6 months after you feel better, although longer courses are sometimes recommended and some people with recurrent problems may be advised to take them indefinitely."}, {"Things to consider": "SSRIs aren't suitable for everyone. They're not usually recommended if you're pregnant, breastfeeding or under 18, because there's an increased risk of serious side effects. However, exceptions can be made if the benefits of treatment are thought to outweigh the risks.\nSSRIs also need to be used with caution if you have certain underlying health problems, including diabetes, epilepsy and kidney disease.\nSome SSRIs can react unpredictably with other medicines, including some over-the-counter painkillers and herbal remedies, such as St John's wort. Always read the information leaflet that comes with your SSRI medicine to check if there are any medicines you need to avoid."}, {"Side effects": "Most people will only experience a few mild side effects when taking SSRIs.

This is thought to be the result of increased exposure to intense sunlight while on holiday abroad.\nMore than 2,300 people die every year in the UK from melanoma."}, {"Diagnosing melanoma": "See a GP if you notice any change to your moles. They'll refer you to a specialist clinic or hospital if they think you have melanoma.\nIn most cases, a suspicious mole will be surgically removed and closely examined to see whether it's cancerous. This is known as a biopsy.\nA biopsy usually involves removing a small sample of tissue. But in cases of melanoma, the whole thing is usually removed from the beginning.\nYou may also have a test to check if melanoma has spread to your lymph glands (nodes). This is known as a sentinel node biopsy.\nRead more about diagnosing melanoma."}, {"Treating melanoma": "The main treatment for melanoma is surgery, although your treatment will depend on your circumstances.\nIf melanoma is diagnosed and treated at an early stage, surgery is usually successful.\nIf melanoma is not diagnosed until an advanced stage, treatment is mainly used to slow the spread of the cancer and reduce symptoms. This usually involves medicines that target specific genetic changes in the melanoma, such as BRAF inhibitors, or medicines that boost your body's immune responses to the melanoma.\nOnce you have had melanoma, there's a chance it may return. This risk is increased if the cancer was more advanced or widespread.\nIf your cancer team feels there's a significant risk of melanoma returning, you'll need regular check-ups to monitor your health. You'll also be taught how to examine your skin and lymph nodes to help detect melanoma if it returns."}, {"Preventing melanoma": "Melanoma is not always preventable, but you can reduce your chances of developing it by avoiding getting sunburned (even going pink in the sun).\nMost people get sunburned while on holiday abroad, or in the UK during the summer while doing outdoor activities such as gardening, sunbathing or playing cricket.\nOn these occasions you need to be very careful, particularly if you have pale skin and many moles.\nYou can help protect yourself from sun damage by using sunscreen and dressing sensibly in the sun.\nSunbeds and sunlamps should be avoided.\nRegularly checking your skin can help lead to an early diagnosis and increase your chances of successful treatment."}, {"No header": "Read more about sunscreen and sun safety."}]}, {"condition": "Skin cancer (non-melanoma)", "sections": [{"No header": "Skin cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world.

It can also look like a red, scaly patch.\nThere's sometimes some brown or black pigment within the patch.\nThe lump slowly gets bigger and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.\nBasal cell carcinoma does not usually spread to other parts of the body. There's a small risk (up to 5%) of squamous cell carcinoma spreading to other parts of the body, usually the lymph nodes (small glands found throughout your body).\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump with a rough or crusted surface. There can be a lot of surface scale and sometimes even a spiky horn sticking up from the surface.\nThe lump often feels tender when touched, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.\nFor both SCC and BCC there can sometimes be considerable skin damage if the tumour is not treated.\nBowen's disease is a precancerous form of Squamous cell carcinoma SCC sometimes referred to as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It develops slowly and is easily treated. \nThe main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin that may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of skin.\nAlthough not classed as non-melanoma skin cancer, Bowen's disease can sometimes develop into SCC if left untreated.\nActinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, are dry, scaly patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure.\nThe patches can be pink, red or brown, and can vary in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres across.\nThe affected skin can sometimes become very thick, and occasionally the patches can look like small horns or spikes.\nLike Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis is not classed as non-melanoma skin cancer, but there's a small risk that the patches could develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) if untreated."}, {"What causes non-melanoma skin cancer?": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer. UV light comes from the sun, as well as from artificial tanning sunbeds and sunlamps.\nOther risk factors that can increase your chances of developing non-melanoma skin cancer include:\n- a previous non-melanoma skin cancer\n- a family history of skin cancer\n- pale skin that burns easily\n- a large number of moles or freckles\n- taking medicine that suppresses your immune system\n- a co-existing medical condition that suppresses your immune system"}, {"Diagnosing non-melanoma skin cancer": "A GP can examine your skin for signs of skin cancer.

Others may get out of bed and walk about, open cupboards, get dressed or eat, and they may appear agitated.\nIn extreme cases, the person may walk out of the house and carry out complex activities, such as driving a car.\nThe eyes are usually open while someone is sleepwalking, although the person will look straight through people and not recognise them. They can often move well around familiar objects.\nIf you talk to a person who is sleepwalking, they may partially respond or say things that do not make sense.\nMost sleepwalking episodes last less than 10 minutes, but they can be longer. At the end of each episode, the person may wake up, or return to bed and go to sleep.\nThey will not normally have any memory of it in the morning or may have patchy memory. If woken while sleepwalking, the person may feel confused and not remember what happened."}, {"What\u00a0to do if you find someone sleepwalking": "The best thing to do if you see someone sleepwalking is to make sure they're safe. If undisturbed, they will often go back to sleep again. Gently guide them back to bed by reassuring them.\nDo not shout or startle the person and do not try to physically restrain them unless they're in danger, as they may lash out."}, {"When\u00a0to get medical advice": "Occasional sleepwalking episodes do not usually need medical attention. Sleepwalking is rarely a sign of anything serious and may get better with time, particularly in children.\nBut, you should consider seeing a GP if sleepwalking happens frequently, you're concerned a person may be at risk of injuring themselves or others, or the episodes continue or start in adult life.\nThe GP may refer you to a specialist sleep centre, where your or your child's sleep history can be discussed in more detail. If appropriate, sleep studies can be arranged to exclude other conditions that could be triggering the sleepwalking, such as obstructive sleep apnoea or restless legs syndrome."}, {"Treatments for\u00a0sleepwalking": "There's no specific treatment for sleepwalking, but it generally helps to try to get enough sleep and have a regular and relaxing routine before bedtime. \nYou may find the following advice helpful:\n- try to go to bed at a similar time each night\n- make sure your bedroom is dark and quiet when you go to sleep\n- limit drinks before bedtime, particularly ones containing caffeine, and go to the toilet before going to sleep\n- find ways to relax before going to bed, such as having a warm bath, reading or deep breathing\n- if your child sleepwalks at the same time most nights, try gently waking them for a short time 15 to 30 minutes before they would normally sleepwalk \u2013 this may stop them sleepwalking by altering their normal sleep cycle\nRead about how to establish a regular bedtime routine and healthy sleep tips for children.\nMedicine is not usually used to treat sleepwalking. However, medicines such as benzodiazepines or antidepressants are sometimes used if you sleepwalk often or there's a risk you could seriously injure yourself or others. These medicines can help you sleep and may reduce the frequency of sleepwalking episodes.\nTherapies such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or hypnotherapy may sometimes be helpful."}, {"Preventing\u00a0accidents": "It's important to keep the areas of your home where a person may sleepwalk free of breakable or potentially harmful objects and to remove any items they could trip over. It's also a good idea to keep windows and doors locked.\nIf your child sleepwalks, do not let them sleep on the top bed of a bunk bed. You may want to fit safety gates at the top of the stairs.\nIt's also important to tell babysitters, relatives or friends who look after your child at night that your child may sleepwalk and what they should do if it happens."}]}, {"condition": "Slipped disc", "sections": [{"No header": "A slipped disc is when a soft cushion of tissue between the bones in your spine pushes out.

It's most often caused by either short bowel syndrome or a non-functioning bowel.\nShort bowel syndrome is where a large part of the small bowel is missing, removed or damaged. \nIt can be caused by:\n- twisting of the bowel (volvulus)\n- a birth defect where some of a baby's bowel develops outside the body (gastroschisis)\n- when part of the tissue of the bowel dies (necrotising enterocolitis)\n- surgery to remove a large section of bowel to treatCrohn's diseaseorbowel cancer\nMost people with short bowel syndrome need some total parenteral nutrition (TPN). In many cases this can be given at home without causing any significant problems.\nHowever, long-term TPN can sometimes lead to complications, which can be life threatening. \nThese problems include:\n- running out of suitable veins to insert a catheter\n- an infection where the catheter is inserted, which can spread through the bloodstream and lead tosepsis\n- liver disease"}, {"Transplant assessment": "If you're being considered for a small bowel transplant, you'll be referred for a transplant assessment. Tests will be done over a period of 1 to 3 weeks to see whether a transplant is the best treatment for you.\nDepending on your overall health, you may need to stay in hospital while these tests are done, or you may only need to go to hospital for a series of outpatient appointments.\nTests you may have include: \n- blood teststo check your liver function, electrolytes, kidney function and see if you have any serious infections, such asHIVorhepatitis\n- a number of scans, such as a chestX-ray, aCT scanof your tummy (abdomen) and anultrasound scanof your liver\n- a colonoscopy, where a long, thin, flexible tube with a small camera inside it is passed into your bottom to check inside your bowels\n- lung function tests\nDuring the assessment, you'll have the chance to meet members of the transplant team and ask questions. \nThe transplant co-ordinator will talk to you and your family about what happens, as well as the risks involved in a small bowel transplant.\nWhen the assessment is complete, a decision will be made about whether a small bowel transplant is the best option for you. \nIt may be unsuitable if:\n- you have cancer that has spread to several areas of your body\n- you have a serious illness with a very poor outlook\n- you require breathing support with a ventilator \u2013 a machine that moves oxygen-enriched air in and out of your lungs\n- you're over 60 years of age\n- you have not acted on your doctor's advice (to quit smoking, for example), you have not taken the medicine prescribed to you, or you've missed hospital appointments"}, {"Waiting for a small bowel transplant": "If you're suitable for a small bowel transplant and are unable to receive a living donation from a family member, you'll be placed on the national waiting list.\nIf you're on the waiting list, the transplant centre will need to contact you at short notice as soon as an organ becomes available for transplantation, so you must inform staff if there are any changes to your contact details.\nYou'll usually be contacted before the transplant surgeons have had a chance to assess the suitability of the donated organs, which means there's a chance you may be called in several times for \"false alarms\" before the operation is eventually done.\nThe length of time you wait depends on: \n- yourblood group\n- donor availability\n- how many other patients are on the list and how urgent their cases are\nOn average, people wait around 2 months for a small bowel transplant.\nWhile you wait, you'll be cared for by the doctor who referred you to the transplant centre. \nYour doctor will keep the transplant team updated about changes to your condition. Another assessment is sometimes necessary to make sure you're still suitable for a transplant."}, {"Types of transplant procedures": "There are three main types of transplant procedures:\n- small bowel transplant only \u2013 this is recommended for people with bowel failure who do not have liver disease\n- combined liver and small bowel transplant \u2013 this is recommended for people with bowel failure who also have advanced liver disease\n- multiple organ (multivisceral) transplant \u2013 although it's not often done, this may be recommended for people with multiple organ failure and involves transplanting the stomach, pancreas, duodenum (the first section of small bowel), liver and small bowel\nIt's sometimes possible to do a small bowel transplant using a section of bowel donated by a living family member.\nIn these cases, the donor will need to have an operation, where the donated part of bowel is removed and the remaining sections of bowel are connected together."}, {"How a small bowel transplant is performed": "A small bowel transplant is done under general anaesthetic and takes around 8 to 10 hours to complete, although it can take longer.\nAfter removing your diseased bowel, your blood vessels are connected to the blood vessels of the transplanted bowel. The transplanted bowel is then connected to your digestive tract or what is left of the bowel.\nYour surgeon will form an ileostomy, where a part of the small bowel is diverted through an opening they make in your abdomen, called a stoma. \nAfter the operation, the ileostomy allows digestive waste to pass out of your body through the stoma into an external pouch. It also lets the transplant team assess the health of your transplanted bowel.\nDepending on your health and the operation's success, your bowel may be reconnected and the ileostomy closed a few months after the transplant, but this is not always possible."}, {"Recovery in hospital": "Immediately after a small bowel transplant you'll be taken to the intensive care unit (ICU) and carefully monitored. This is so the transplant team can check your body is accepting the new organ.\nWhile in the ICU, you'll have various tubes in your veins to provide medicines and fluids, and you'll be attached to monitoring equipment.\nYou may also have regular bowel biopsies, where small samples of tissue are taken for testing, using the ileostomy created by the surgeon.\nAlternatively, you may have an endoscopy, where a long, thin tube with a camera on the end is inserted into the stoma to examine the inside of your bowel.\nThe transplant team can determine whether your body is rejecting the donor bowel from your biopsy results. If it is, you'll be given extra treatment with medicines to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).\nOnce you've started to recover, you'll usually be transferred to a specialist transplant ward where you'll continue to be given painkillers, immunosuppressant medicine and nutrition through a tube into a vein (TPN).\nOver time, the majority of people are able to move on from TPN to eating a normal diet fed through the mouth."}, {"Recovery at home": "On average, people who have a small bowel transplant are discharged from hospital after around 4 to 6 weeks.\nIf you live a long distance from the hospital, you may need to stay in accommodation provided by the hospital nearby, for 1 to 2 months after you are discharged, so you can be monitored and treated quickly if any problems develop.\nYou'll be given immunosuppressant medicine to help prevent your body rejecting the transplant. You will need to take this medicine for the rest of your life.\nFor the first few weeks or months after leaving hospital you'll need to continue having regular blood tests and endoscopies, but these will be done less often over time. Eventually you may only need to see your surgeon once a year and have blood tests every few months.\nAlthough it can take a long time to make a full recovery from a small bowel transplant, and there's a risk of potentially serious complications, the aim of the operation is to allow you to eventually live as normal a life as possible \u2013 including working, enjoying hobbies and living independently."}, {"Risks of a small bowel transplant": "As with all types of surgery, there are risks associated with having a small bowel transplant.\nBetter anti-rejection medicines, refined surgical procedures and a greater understanding of the body's immune system have increased the number of successful bowel transplants and improved survival rates in recent years.\nHowever, potentially serious complications can still happen:\n- heart and breathing problems\n- infection of the small bowel \u2013 such as an infection by thecytomegalovirus (CMV)\n- blood clots (thrombosis)\n- post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) \u2013 where the Epstein-Barr virus infects white blood cells, which can lead to abnormal growths throughout the body and multiple organ failure, if not treated quickly\n- rejection of the donor organ\n- problems associated with the long-term use of anti-rejection medication \u2013 such as an increased risk of infections, kidney problems and certain types ofcancer\nBecause of these risks and the overall poor health of people who are considered for a small bowel transplant, some people die within a few years of the procedure. \nHowever, the majority of adults and children who have the operation live for at least another 5 years.\nRejection is a normal reaction of the body. When a new organ is transplanted, your body's immune system sees it as a threat and makes antibodies, which can stop the organ working properly.\nImmunosuppressant medicines that weaken your immune system are given during and after your transplant and must be taken for life to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the donor bowel.\nAs well as stopping the donated organ working properly, rejection can sometimes mean that bacteria found in the small bowel can get into your bloodstream and cause a serious widespread infection. \nYou'll be closely monitored by the transplant team after surgery to reduce this risk.\nThere's another rare type of rejection where the immune cells transplanted with the new organ fight against the cells of the host. \nThis is called graft versus host disease (GvHD). GvHD can happen within a few weeks of a transplant or, less commonly, a few months or even years later.\nIn some cases where the transplant fails, you may be put on the waiting list again for another transplant."}]}, {"condition": "Smear test, see Cervical screening", "sections": [{"No header": "- Cervical screening (a smear test) checks the health of your cervix.

This helps to ensure no cancer cells are left behind.\nEvery effort will be made to reduce the impact of surgery on the appearance and function of the affected body part. But there is a chance you'll have some difficulty using the affected body part after surgery and sometimes further surgery may be needed to repair it.\nIn a very small number of cases, there may be no option but to amputate the part of the body where the cancer is located, such as part of the leg.\nIn some sarcomas, radiotherapy is used before or after surgery to improve the chance of cure. This is done using a machine that directs beams of radiation at a small treatment area.\nRadiotherapy alone may also sometimes be used when surgery is not possible, to reduce symptoms caused by the sarcoma or slow its progression.\nCommon side effects of radiotherapy include sore skin, tiredness and hair loss in the treatment area. These tend to get better within a few days or weeks of treatment finishing.\nChemotherapy is very occasionally used before surgery to shrink a tumour and make it easier to remove. This involves being given cancer-killing medicine directly into a vein (intravenously).\nChemotherapy may also be used alone or alongside radiotherapy for soft tissue sarcomas that can't be surgically removed.\nCommon side effects of chemotherapy include feeling tired and weak all the time, feeling and being sick, and hair loss.

However, larger, high-grade tumours have a greater risk of coming back or spreading.\nAfter initial treatment, you'll need regular check-ups to look for any signs the cancer has come back.

It can also look like a red, scaly patch.\nThere's sometimes some brown or black pigment within the patch.\nThe lump slowly gets bigger and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.\nBasal cell carcinoma does not usually spread to other parts of the body. There's a small risk (up to 5%) of squamous cell carcinoma spreading to other parts of the body, usually the lymph nodes (small glands found throughout your body).\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump with a rough or crusted surface. There can be a lot of surface scale and sometimes even a spiky horn sticking up from the surface.\nThe lump often feels tender when touched, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.\nFor both SCC and BCC there can sometimes be considerable skin damage if the tumour is not treated.\nBowen's disease is a precancerous form of Squamous cell carcinoma SCC sometimes referred to as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It develops slowly and is easily treated. \nThe main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin that may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of skin.\nAlthough not classed as non-melanoma skin cancer, Bowen's disease can sometimes develop into SCC if left untreated.\nActinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, are dry, scaly patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure.\nThe patches can be pink, red or brown, and can vary in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres across.\nThe affected skin can sometimes become very thick, and occasionally the patches can look like small horns or spikes.\nLike Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis is not classed as non-melanoma skin cancer, but there's a small risk that the patches could develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) if untreated."}, {"What causes non-melanoma skin cancer?": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer.

This can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure.\nAs the brain continues to develop, some of these problems resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children \"grow out\" of stammering.\nStammering is more common in boys than girls.

However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.\nCoronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)."}, {"When a coronary angioplasty is used": "Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries.\nIn older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease.\nIf the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. \nWhile angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective.\nCoronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack."}, {"What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty?": "In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they're able to do more than they could before the procedure.\nIf you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future."}, {"How a coronary angioplasty is performed": "A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out.\nA thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video.\nWhen the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed.\nIf a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed.\nA coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week. \nIf you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home.\nRead more about: \n- what happens during a coronary angioplasty\n- recovering from a coronary angioplasty"}, {"How safe is a coronary angioplasty?": "A coronary angioplasty is 1 of the most common types of treatment for the heart. \nCoronary angioplasties are most commonly performed in people aged 65 or older, as they're more likely to have heart disease.\nAs the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people.

Their period may be early or late, and how long it lasts and how heavy it is may vary each time.\nRead more about irregular periods and heavy periods."}, {"Why your periods might stop": "There are a number of reasons why your periods can stop. The most common reasons are:\n- pregnancy\n- stress\n- sudden weight loss\n- being overweight\n- doing too much exercise\n- taking thecontraceptive pill\n- themenopause\n- polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPeriods can also sometimes stop as a result of a medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature menopause.\nYou might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails.\nIt might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it does not arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant.\nIt's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress.\nIf you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful.\nTry to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help.\nIf you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act.\nExcessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation.\nYour GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, which is when you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. A dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely.\nIf your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, they may refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists.\nBeing overweight can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women.\nExcess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop.\nYour GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely.\nThe stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating.\nYou'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop.\nIf you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods.\nYou might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This is not usually a cause for concern.\nSome types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill (POP), contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether.\nHowever, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception.\nYou may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels start to decrease, and ovulation becomes less regular. After the menopause, your periods stop completely.\nThe menopause is a natural part of ageing in women, which usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK.\nHowever, around 1 in 100 women go through the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure.\nPolycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation does not take place.\nPCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK.

This can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure.\nAs the brain continues to develop, some of these problems resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children \"grow out\" of stammering.\nStammering is more common in boys than girls.
