[{"condition": "Pacemaker implantation", "sections": [{"No header": "If you need to have a pacemaker fitted, a small electrical device called a pacemaker will be surgically implanted in your chest.\nThe pacemaker sends electrical pulses to your heart to keep it beating regularly and not too slowly.\nHaving a pacemaker can significantly improve your quality of life if you have problems with a slow heart rate. The device can be lifesaving for some people.\nIn the UK, pacemaker implantation is one of the most common types of heart surgery carried out, with many thousands of pacemakers fitted each year."}, {"How a pacemaker works": "A pacemaker is a small device about the size of a matchbox or smaller that weighs 20 to 50g. \nIt consists of a pulse generator, which has a battery and a tiny computer circuit, and 1 or more wires known as pacing leads, which attach to your heart.\nThe pulse generator emits electrical impulses through the wires to your heart. The rate at which the electrical impulses are sent out is called the pacing rate.\nAlmost all modern pacemakers work on demand. This means they can be programmed to adjust the discharge rate in response to your body's needs. \nIf the pacemaker senses that your heart has missed a beat or is beating too slowly, it sends signals at a steady rate. \nIf it senses that your heart is beating normally by itself, it doesn't send out any signals.\nMost pacemakers have a special sensor that recognises body movement or your breathing rate. \nThis allows them to speed up the discharge rate when you're active. Doctors describe this as rate responsive."}, {"Implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs)": "An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a device similar to a pacemaker. \nIt sends a larger electrical shock to the heart that essentially \"reboots\" it to get it pumping again. \nSome devices contain both a pacemaker and an ICD. \nICDs are often used as a preventative treatment for people thought to be at risk of cardiac arrest at some point in the future. \nIf the ICD senses the heart is beating at a potentially dangerous abnormal rate, it'll deliver an electrical shock to the heart. \nThis often helps return the heart to a normal rhythm.\nA conventional ICD has a pacing lead that's implanted along a vein (transvenously). \nThere's also a newer type of ICD where the pacing lead is implanted under the skin (subcutaneously)."}, {"Why do I need a pacemaker?": "The heart is essentially a pump made of muscle, which is controlled by electrical signals.\nThese signals can become disrupted for several reasons, which can lead to a number of potentially dangerous heart conditions, such as:\n- an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia)\n- an abnormally fast heartbeat(tachycardia)\n- heart block(where your heart beats irregularly because the electrical signals that control your heartbeat aren't transmitted properly)\n- cardiac arrest (when a problem with the heart's electrical signals cause the heart to stop beating altogether)\nRead more about why you might need a pacemaker."}, {"How is a pacemaker fitted?": "Having a pacemaker implanted is a relatively straightforward process. \nIt's usually carried out under local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure.\nThe generator is usually placed under the skin near the collarbone on the left side of the chest. \nThe generator is attached to a wire that's guided through a blood vessel to the heart. \nThe procedure usually takes about an hour, and most people are able to leave hospital on the same day or a day after surgery.\nRead more about how a pacemaker is fitted."}, {"After pacemaker surgery": "You should be able to return to normal physical activities soon after surgery. \nAs a precaution, it's usually recommended that strenuous activities are avoided for around 4 to 6 weeks after having a pacemaker fitted. \nAfter this, you should be able to do most activities and sports.\nYou'll be able to feel the pacemaker, but you'll soon get used to it. It may seem a bit heavy at first, and may feel uncomfortable when you lie in certain positions.\nYou'll need to attend regular check-ups to make sure your pacemaker is working properly. Most pacemakers store information about your natural heart rhythms. \nWhen you have follow-up appointments, your doctor can retrieve this information and use it to check how well your heart and the pacemaker are working.\nRead more about recovering from pacemaker surgery."}, {"Using electrical equipment": "Anything that produces a strong electromagnetic field, like an induction hob, can interfere with a pacemaker.\nBut most common household electrical equipment, such as hairdryers and microwave ovens, won't be a problem as long as you use them at least 15cm (6 inches) away from your pacemaker. \nIf you have an induction hob, keep a distance of at least 60cm (2ft) between the stove top and your pacemaker. \nIf this is a problem, you may want to consider replacing the appliance with something more suitable.\nIf you feel dizzy or feel your heart beating faster while using an electrical appliance, simply move away from it to allow your heart beat to return to normal."}, {"Safety": "Having a pacemaker implanted is usually a very safe procedure with a low risk of complications. \nThe biggest concern is the pacemaker losing its ability to control the heartbeat, either because it malfunctions or the wire moves out of the correct position.\nIt's sometimes possible to reprogramme the pacemaker to fix a malfunction using wireless signals. \nBut further surgery may be needed if the pacemaker moves out of position.\nRead more about the risks of having a pacemaker."}, {"Alternatives to a pacemaker": "In some cases, it may be possible to control an abnormal heartbeat (arrhythmia) without having a pacemaker fitted. \nFor example, atrial fibrillation can sometimes be treated with medication or a non-surgical procedure called catheter ablation.\nBut not all people with an arrhythmia can be treated in this way, and in many cases a pacemaker is considered to be the most effective option.\nIf your cardiologist recommends having a pacemaker fitted, ask them why they think it's the best option and discuss any possible alternative treatments you could have."}, {"New technology": "A new, smaller pacemaker about the size of a pill has been developed and is currently being tested in a global clinical trial.\nThe new device uses wireless technology and can be implanted directly into the heart, where it delivers electrical impulses from an electrode.\nThis means a pacing lead isn't required, which has the benefits of lowering the risk of infection and shortening the recovery time associated with implanting traditional pacemakers."}]}, {"condition": "Paget's disease of bone", "sections": [{"No header": "Paget's disease of bone disrupts the normal cycle of bone renewal, causing bones to become weakened and possibly deformed.\nIt's a fairly common condition in the UK, particularly in older people. It's rare in people under 50 years of age.\nThere are treatments that can help keep it under control for many years, but it can cause persistent pain and a range of other problems in some people."}, {"Symptoms\u00a0of Paget's disease of bone": "Paget's disease of bone can affect 1 bone or several bones. Commonly affected areas include the pelvis, spine and skull.\nSymptoms can include:\n- constant, dull bone pain\n- joint pain, stiffness and swelling\n- a shooting pain that travels along or across the body,numbness and tingling, or loss of movement in part of the body\nBut in many cases there are no symptoms and the condition is only found during tests carried out for another reason.\nRead more about the symptoms of Paget's disease of bone."}, {"When\u00a0to see your GP": "See your GP if you have:\n- persistent bone or joint pain\n- deformities in any of your bones\n- symptoms of a nerve problem, such as numbness, tingling or loss of movement\nYour GP can organise tests to check your bones and look for problems such as Paget's disease of bone.\nRead more about how Paget's disease of bone is diagnosed."}, {"Causes\u00a0of Paget's disease of bone": "Bone cells regenerate in a similar way to skin \u2013 old bone is removed and replaced by new bone. This is known as bone remodelling.\n2 cells are responsible for this:\n- osteoclasts \u2013 cells that absorb old bone\n- osteoblasts \u2013 cells that make new bone\nIn Paget's disease of bone, something goes wrong with the osteoclast cells and they start to absorb bone at a much faster rate than usual.\nThe osteoblasts then try to produce new bone more quickly, but the new bone is larger and weaker than normal.\nIt's not clear what triggers this, but you're at a higher risk if you have a family history of Paget's disease of bone. You may inherit a genetic fault that means you're much more likely to develop the condition."}, {"Treatments\u00a0for Paget's disease of bone": "There's currently no cure for Paget's disease of bone, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms.\nIf you do not have any symptoms, your doctor may suggest keeping an eye on your condition and delaying treatment until any problems occur.\nThe main treatments are:\n- bisphosphonate medication \u2013 medicines that help control bone regeneration\n- painkillers \u2013 usually over-the-counter painkillers such asparacetamolandibuprofen\n- supportive therapies \u2013 includingphysiotherapy,occupational therapyand devices such as walking sticks or shoe inserts\n- surgery \u2013 this may be needed if further problems develop, such as fractures, deformities or severe joint damage\nEnsuring you get enough calcium and vitamin D can also help. Some people may need to take supplements.\nRead more about how Paget's disease of bone is treated."}, {"Further\u00a0problems\u00a0caused by Paget's disease of bone": "Paget's disease of bone can sometimes lead to further, potentially serious problems.\nThese include:\n- fragile bones that break more easily than normal\n- enlarged or misshapen bones\n- permanenthearing loss(if the skull is affected)\n- too much calcium in the blood\n- heart problems\n- in rare cases,bone cancer\nRead more about possible complications of Paget's disease of bone."}, {"Other\u00a0types of Paget's disease": "In addition to Paget's disease of bone, there are several other types of Paget's disease.\nThese include:\n- Paget's disease of the breast or nipple\u2013 a rare type ofbreast cancer\n- Paget's disease of the penis \u2013 a rare type ofpenile cancer\n- Paget's disease of the vulva \u2013 a rare type ofvulval cancer\nThe general term \"Paget's disease\" is sometimes used to refer to Paget's disease of bone."}, {"Video: Paget's disease": "In this video, an expert describes the various areas of the body that can be affected by Paget's disease."}]}, {"condition": "Paget's disease of the nipple", "sections": [{"No header": "Paget's disease of the nipple, also known as Paget's disease of the breast, is a rare condition associated with breast cancer.\nIt causes eczema-like changes to the skin of the nipple and the area of darker skin surrounding the nipple (areola). It's usually a sign of breast cancer in the tissue behind the nipple.\nAbout 1 to 4% of women with breast cancer have Paget's disease of the nipple. It can also affect men, but this is extremely rare.\nThe term Paget's disease of the nipple is used to distinguish the condition from Paget's disease of the bone (where bones become weak and deformed)."}, {"Symptoms of Paget's disease of the nipple": "Paget's disease of the nipple always starts in the nipple and may extend to the areola. It appears as a red, scaly rash on the skin of the nipple and areola.\nThe affected skin is often sore and inflamed, and it can be itchy or cause a burning sensation. The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated.\nThe rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis. If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over.\nIf you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's disease of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor.\nAround half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer.\nInvasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue. Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump.\nHowever, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer.\nThis is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread."}, {"Causes of Paget's disease of the nipple": "The cause of Paget's disease of the nipple is unknown. Some women appear to be more at risk of developing breast cancer, but not specifically Paget's disease. There are no known causes that lead to a specific type of breast cancer.\nIn terms of risk factors, you're more likely to develop breast cancer if you:\n- are older \u2013 the risk of developing breast cancer increases with age\n- have close relatives with breast cancer\n- have had breast cancer before\n- have had a type of benign (non-cancerous) breast disease before \u2013 certain types of benign breast disease may be associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but this is only seen in a very small number of women\n- are overweight \u2013 particularly if you've been through the menopause (you can use theBMI healthy weight calculatorto find out whether you're overweight or obese)\n- drink a lot of alcohol \u2013 your risk can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink\nRead more about the risk factors for breast cancer."}, {"Diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple": "You should see your GP if you notice any changes in the skin of your nipple or areola.\nAs Paget's disease of the nipple is associated with breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be.\nAlso see your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. Although most breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important to have them checked out.\nA biopsy is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Paget's disease of the nipple. A small tissue sample (punch biopsy of the skin) will be taken from your nipple and examined under a microscope to see if it's cancerous.\nIf the results of the biopsy indicate Paget's disease, you'll have a mammogram (a low-dose breast X-ray) to investigate further.\nRead more about diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple."}, {"Treating Paget's disease of the nipple": "Surgery is the main treatment for Paget's disease of the nipple. Depending on whether the cancer has spread, surgery will either involve removing the whole breast (a mastectomy), or the nipple and areola with the breast tissue underneath them (a central excision).\nIf the whole of your breast is removed, breast reconstruction surgery can be used to create a breast shape to match your remaining breast.\nYou may also need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer. This may be a combination of:\n- chemotherapy\u2013 where powerful medicine is used to destroy cancerous cells\n- radiotherapy\u2013 where controlled doses of high-energyradiationare used to destroy cancerous cells\n- targeted or hormone therapy \u2013 which lowers the risk of cancer returning in the same breast (and affecting the other breast), and it lowers the risk of cancerous cells spreading elsewhere in the body\nIf Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of a full recovery.\nRead more about treating Paget's disease of the nipple."}, {"Reducing the risk of breast cancer, including Paget's disease of the nipple": "Modifying certain lifestyle factors, such as reducing the amount of alcohol you drink and making sure you exercise regularly, may reduce your risk of developing certain types of cancer, including breast cancer.\nBreast cancer screening is also used to help detect breast cancer early. In the UK, the NHS Breast Screening Programme provides free breast screening every 3 years for all women aged 50 to 70.\nIn some areas, women aged 47 to 49 and 71 to 73 are also invited for screening as part of a study looking at whether the age range for breast screening should be extended.\nRead more about reducing the risks of breast cancer."}]}, {"condition": "Pain in testicles, see Testicle pain", "sections": [{"No header": "There are lots of possible causes of pain in the testicles (balls).

Some periods may cause little or no discomfort, while others may be more painful.\nSometimes you may get pelvic pain even when you do not have your period."}, {"Causes of period pain": "Period pain happens when the muscular wall of the womb tightens (contracts). Mild contractions continually occur in your womb, but they're usually so mild that most women cannot feel them.\nDuring your period, the wall of the womb starts to contract more vigorously to help the womb lining shed as part of your period.\nWhen the wall of the womb contracts, it compresses the blood vessels lining your womb. This temporarily cuts off the blood supply \u2013 and oxygen supply \u2013 to your womb. Without oxygen, the tissues in your womb release chemicals that trigger pain.\nWhile your body is releasing these pain-triggering chemicals, it's also producing other chemicals called prostaglandins. These encourage the womb muscles to contract more, further increasing the level of pain.\nIt's not known why some women have more period pain than others. It may be that some women have a build-up of prostaglandins, which means they experience stronger contractions.\nLess commonly, period pain can be caused by an underlying medical condition.\nPeriod pain linked to an underlying medical condition tends to affect older women. Women aged 30 to 45 are most commonly affected.\nMedical conditions that can cause period pain include:\n- endometriosis\u2013 where cells that normally line the womb grow in other places, such as in the fallopian tubes and ovaries; these cells can cause intense pain when they shed\n- fibroids\u2013 non-cancerous tumours that can grow in or around the womb and can make your periods heavy and painful\n- pelvic inflammatory disease\u2013 where your womb, fallopian tubes and ovaries become infected with bacteria, causing them to become severely inflamed\n- adenomyosis \u2013 where the tissue that normally lines the womb starts to grow within the muscular womb wall, making your periods particularly painful\nAn intrauterine device (IUD) is a type of contraception made from copper and plastic that fits inside the womb. It can also sometimes cause period pain, particularly during the first few months after it's inserted.\nYou may notice a change in your normal pattern of pain if your period pain is linked to a medical condition or a contraceptive IUD. For example, the pain may be more severe or it may last much longer than normal.\nYou may also have:\n- irregular periods\n- bleeding in between periods\n- a thick or foul-smellingvaginal discharge\n- pain during sex\nSee a GP if you have any of these symptoms as well as period pain."}, {"How long period pain lasts": "Period pain usually starts when your bleeding begins, although some women have pain several days before the start of their period.\nThe pain usually lasts 48 to 72 hours, although it can last longer.

Aspirin should not be taken by anyone under 16 years of age.\nYou could also try paracetamol, but studies have shown that it does not reduce pain as well as ibuprofen or aspirin.\nIf ordinary painkillers do not help, your GP may prescribe a stronger painkiller, such as naproxen or codeine.\nYou could also try:\n- stopping smoking \u2013 smoking is thought to increase the risk of period pain\n- exercise \u2013 you may not feel like exercising during a painful period, but being active may reduce pain; try some gentle swimming, walking or cycling\n- heat \u2013 putting a heat pad or hot water bottle (wrapped in a tea towel) on your tummy may help reduce pain\n- warm bath or shower \u2013 taking a warm bath or shower can relieve pain and help you relax\n- massage \u2013 light, circular massage around your lower abdomen may also help reduce pain\n- relaxation techniques \u2013 relaxing activities, such as yoga or pilates, may help distract you from feelings of pain and discomfort\n- transcutaneous electronic nerve stimulation (TENS)\u2013 a small battery-operated device that delivers a mild electrical current to your tummy to help reduce pain"}, {"When to see a GP": "See a GP if you have severe period pain or your normal pattern of periods changes \u2013 for example, if your periods become heavier than usual or irregular.\nThe GP may want to feel your tummy (abdomen) to check it feels normal.\nIf your symptoms are unusual, the GP may carry out an internal examination, sometimes known as a pelvic examination. This can be helpful in diagnosing or ruling out other causes of your period pain.\nYou may be prescribed the contraceptive pill. It can ease period pain because it thins the womb lining and reduces the amount of prostaglandin your body releases.\nA thinner womb lining means the muscles of the womb do not have to contract as much when it sheds. Your period will also be lighter.\nIf the contraceptive pill is not suitable for you, the contraceptive implant or the contraceptive injection are good alternatives.\nThe Mirena intrauterine system (IUS) can also sometimes help with painful periods.\nIf your period pain has not been controlled after 3 months of treatment with painkillers or a suitable hormonal contraceptive, your GP may refer you to a specialist, which will usually be a gynaecologist.\nThe specialist will carry out further tests to help confirm or rule out an underlying medical condition.

The most common reasons are:\n- pregnancy\n- stress\n- sudden weight loss\n- being overweight\n- doing too much exercise\n- taking thecontraceptive pill\n- themenopause\n- polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)\nPeriods can also sometimes stop as a result of a medical condition, such as heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, an overactive thyroid, or premature menopause.\nYou might be pregnant if you're sexually active and your period is late. Pregnancy is a common reason why periods unexpectedly stop. It can sometimes happen if the contraception you're using fails.\nIt might be that your period is simply late, so you could wait a few days to see if it arrives. If it does not arrive, you can do a pregnancy test to confirm whether or not you're pregnant.\nIt's important to be aware that you can get pregnant in the days after your period is normally due. This can happen if the release of an egg (ovulation) is delayed \u2013 for example, as a result of illness or stress.\nIf you're stressed, your menstrual cycle can become longer or shorter, your periods may stop altogether, or they might become more painful.\nTry to avoid becoming stressed by making sure you have time to relax. Regular exercise, such as running, swimming and yoga, can help you relax. Breathing exercises can also help.\nIf you're finding it hard to cope with stress, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) may be recommended. CBT is a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and act.\nExcessive or sudden weight loss can cause your periods to stop. Severely restricting the amount of calories you eat stops the production of hormones needed for ovulation.\nYour GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're underweight, which is when you have a body mass index (BMI) of less than 18.5. A dietitian will be able to advise you about how to regain weight safely.\nIf your weight loss is caused by an eating disorder, such as anorexia, they may refer you to an eating disorder specialist or team of specialists.\nBeing overweight can also affect your menstrual cycle. If you're overweight, your body may produce an excess amount of oestrogen, one of the hormones that regulate the reproductive system in women.\nExcess oestrogen can affect how often you have periods, and can also cause your periods to stop.\nYour GP may refer you to a dietitian if you're overweight, with a BMI of 30 or more, and it's affecting your periods. The dietitian will be able to advise you about losing weight safely.\nThe stress that intense physical activity places on your body can affect the hormones responsible for your periods. Losing too much body fat through intense exercise can also stop you ovulating.\nYou'll be advised to reduce your level of activity if excessive exercise has caused your periods to stop.\nIf you're a professional athlete, you may benefit from seeing a doctor who specialises in sports medicine. They'll be able to give you advice about how to maintain your performance without disrupting your periods.\nYou might miss a period every so often if you're taking the contraceptive pill. This is not usually a cause for concern.\nSome types of contraception, such as the progestogen-only pill (POP), contraceptive injection and intrauterine system (IUS), particularly Mirena, can cause periods to stop altogether.\nHowever, your periods should return when you stop using these types of contraception.\nYou may start missing periods as you approach the menopause. This is because oestrogen levels start to decrease, and ovulation becomes less regular. After the menopause, your periods stop completely.\nThe menopause is a natural part of ageing in women, which usually happens between the ages of 45 and 55. The average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51 in the UK.\nHowever, around 1 in 100 women go through the menopause before the age of 40. This is known as premature menopause or premature ovarian failure.\nPolycystic ovaries contain a large number of harmless follicles, which are underdeveloped sacs in which eggs develop. If you have PCOS, these sacs are often unable to release an egg, which means ovulation does not take place.\nPCOS is thought to be very common, affecting about 1 in every 10 women in the UK.

Treatment includes a special diet and regular blood tests.\nWith early diagnosis and the correct treatment, most children with PKU are able to live healthy lives.\nAbout 1 in 10,000 babies born in the UK has PKU."}, {"Symptoms of PKU": "PKU does not usually cause any symptoms if treatment is started early. \nWithout treatment, PKU can damage the brain and nervous system, which can lead to learning disabilities.\nOther symptoms of untreated PKU include:\n- behavioural difficulties such as frequent temper tantrums and episodes ofself-harm\n- fairer skin, hair and eyes than siblings who do not have the condition (phenylalanine is involved in the body's production of melanin, the pigment responsible for skin and hair colour)\n- eczema\n- repeatably being sick\n- jerking movements in arms and legs\n- tremors\n- epilepsy\n- musty smell to the breath, skin and urine"}, {"Treating\u00a0PKU": "The main treatment for PKU is a low-protein diet that completely avoids high-protein foods (such as meat, eggs and dairy products) and controls the intake of many other foods, such as potatoes and cereals.\nIn addition, people with PKU must take an amino acid supplement to ensure they're getting all the nutrients required for normal growth and good health.\nThere are also several low-protein versions of common foods (such as flour, rice and pasta) specifically designed for people with PKU and related conditions to incorporate into their diets. Many of these are available on prescription.\nIf a high phenylalanine level is confirmed, a baby will immediately be started on a low-protein diet and amino acid supplements. \nPhenylalanine levels are regularly monitored by collecting blood from a finger prick on to a special card and sending it to a laboratory.\nA dietitian will create a detailed dietary plan for your child that can be revised as your child grows and their needs change.\nAs long as a person with PKU sticks to a low-protein diet throughout childhood, and their phenylalanine levels stay within certain limits, they'll remain well and their natural intelligence will be unaffected.\nPeople with PKU must also avoid food products that contain aspartame, as it's converted into phenylalanine in the body. \nAspartame is a sweetener found in:\n- sugar substitutes such as the artificial sweeteners often used in tea and coffee\n- diet versions of fizzy drinks\n- chewing gum\n- squash and cordial\n- some alcopops\nAll food products that contain aspartame or a related product should be clearly labelled.\nThere are also medicines that contain aspartame, such as some children's cold and flu remedies. \nIt's a legal requirement for any medicine that contains aspartame to state it on the patient information leaflet that comes with the medicine.\nA child with phenylketonuria will need regular blood tests to measure levels of phenylalanine in their blood and assess how well they're responding to treatment. \nOnly a drop of blood is needed, and it can be collected at home and sent to the hospital by post.\nYou may be able to have training so you can do your child's blood tests, or be able to test yourself if you have PKU. This will make testing more convenient.\nIt's recommended that children who are:\n- 6 months of age or younger should have their blood tested once a week\n- between 6 months and 4 years of age should have their blood tested once every 2 weeks\n- over 4 years of age should have their blood tested once a month\nSomeone with PKU will usually need to have regular blood tests throughout their life."}, {"How PKU is inherited": "The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for PKU is passed on by the parents, who are usually carriers and do not have any symptoms of the condition themselves.\nThe way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 1 from their mother and 1 from their father. \nIf the baby only receives 1 affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of PKU.\nIf you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:\n- a 1 in 4 chance of inheriting the condition\n- a 1 in 2 chance of being a carrier of PKU\n- a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes"}, {"Adults with PKU": "Many adults with PKU find they function best while on a low-protein diet. The current advice is for people with PKU to remain on a low-protein diet for life.\nUnlike in young children, there is not yet any evidence that high phenylalanine levels cause any permanent brain damage in adults with PKU.\nSome adults with PKU may have higher phenylalanine levels because they find it difficult to follow the low-protein diet or have returned to a normal diet. \nAs a result, they may find they do not function as well. For example, they may lose concentration or have a slower reaction time.\nThese adverse effects can usually be reversed by going back on to a strict diet to bring the phenylalanine levels down again.\nAnyone who returned to a normal diet should still be supported by their clinicians and have a regular follow-up to monitor their condition for any complications that might arise.\nFor women with PKU, it's essential that they return to a strict diet if they're considering becoming pregnant, as high phenylalanine levels can harm an unborn child."}, {"PKU and pregnancy": "Women with PKU must take particular care during pregnancy, as high levels of phenylalanine can damage their unborn baby.\nProvided that phenylalanine levels are strictly controlled during pregnancy, problems can be avoided and there's no reason why a woman with PKU should not be able to have a normal, healthy baby.\nIt's recommended that all women with PKU plan their pregnancies carefully. You should aim to follow a strict low-protein diet and monitor your blood twice a week before becoming pregnant. \nIt's best to try to conceive once phenylalanine levels are within the target range for pregnancy.\nDuring pregnancy, you'll be asked to provide blood samples 3 times a week and will be in frequent contact with a dietitian. \nAs soon as your baby is born, phenylalanine control can be relaxed and there's no reason why you cannot breastfeed your baby.\nContact your PKU doctor and dietitian as soon as possible if you become pregnant when your phenylalanine levels are not adequately controlled. \nIf your phenylalanine levels can be brought under control within the first few weeks of your pregnancy, the risk of damage to your baby should be small. But your pregnancy will need to be monitored very carefully.\nIf you or your child has PKU, your clinical team will pass on information about you to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

In some cases, an underlying cause can't be identified.\n\"Apparent polycythaemia\" is where your red cell count is normal, but you have a reduced amount of a fluid called plasma in your blood, making it thicker.\nApparent polycythaemia is often caused by being overweight, smoking, drinking too much alcohol or taking certain medicines \u2013 including diuretics (tablets for high blood pressure that make you pee more).\nApparent polycythaemia may improve if the underlying cause is identified and managed. Stopping smoking or reducing your alcohol intake, for example, may help.\nThis is similar to apparent polycythaemia. It can happen as a result of dehydration.\n\"Absolute polycythaemia\" is where your body produces too many red blood cells. There are 2 main types:\n- primary polycythaemia\u2013 there's a problem in the cells produced by the bone marrow that become red blood cells; the most common type is known as polycythaemia vera (PV)\n- secondary polycythaemia\u2013 too many red blood cells are produced as the result of an underlying condition\nPV is rare. It's usually caused by a change in the JAK2 gene, which causes the bone marrow cells to produce too many red blood cells.\nThe affected bone marrow cells can also develop into other cells found in the blood, which means that people with PV may also have abnormally high numbers of both platelets and white bloods cells.\nAlthough caused by a genetic change, PV isn't usually inherited. Most cases develop later in life. The average age at diagnosis is 60.\nSecondary polycythaemia is where an underlying condition causes more erythropoietin to be produced. This is a hormone produced by the kidneys that stimulates the bone marrow cells to produce red blood cells.\nHealth conditions that can cause secondary polycythaemia include:\n- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)andsleep apnoea\u2013 these can cause an increase in erythropoietin, due to not enough oxygen reaching the body's tissues\n- a problem with the kidneys \u2013 such as akidney tumouror narrowing of the arteries supplying blood to the kidneys"}, {"How polycythaemia is diagnosed": "Polycythaemia can be diagnosed by carrying out a blood test to check:\n- the number of red blood cells in your blood (red blood cell count)\n- the amount of space the red blood cells take up in the blood (haematocrit level)\nA high concentration of red blood cells suggests you have polycythaemia.\nPolycythaemia is sometimes only discovered during a routine blood test for another reason.\nYour GP may refer you to a haematologist (a specialist in blood disorders) for more tests, to confirm the diagnosis and to determine the underlying cause.\nThese may include:\n- a blood test to look for the changed JAK2 gene\n- anultrasound scanof your tummy to look for problems in your kidneys"}, {"Treatments for polycythaemia": "Treatment for polycythaemia aims to prevent symptoms and complications (such as blood clots), and treat any underlying causes.\nVenesection is the simplest and quickest way of reducing the number of red cells in your blood. It may be recommended if you have PV, a history of blood clots, or symptoms suggesting your blood is too thick.\nVenesection involves removing about 1 pint (half a litre) of blood at a time, in a similar way to the procedure used for blood donation.\nHow often this is needed will be different for each person. At first, you may need the treatment every week, but once your polycythaemia is under control you may only need it every 6 to 12 weeks or less.\nFor more information, read an NHS leaflet on having a venesection (PDF, 336kb). \nIn cases of PV, medicine may be prescribed to slow down the production of red blood cells.\nMany different medicines are available and your specialist will take into account your age and health, response to venesection and red blood cell count when choosing the most appropriate one for you. Examples include:\n- hydroxycarbamide\u2013 this medicine is taken as tablets every morning and is generally tolerated well. But you should not take it if you're pregnant or trying to become pregnant\n- interferon\u2013 this medicine is given by injection into the abdomen or thigh 1 to 3 times a week. You can inject it yourself at home once you've become familiar with how to do it. Interferon has the advantage that it can be taken in pregnancy, but it may cause unpleasant side effects, such ashair lossandflu-like symptoms\nIf you have PV, daily low-dose aspirin tablets may be prescribed to help prevent blood clots and reduce the risk of serious complications.\nYou may also be offered treatment with low-dose aspirin if you have apparent or secondary polycythaemia and another health problem affecting your blood vessels, such as coronary heart disease or cerebrovascular disease."}, {"Treating and preventing other symptoms": "Some people may also need treatment for any other symptoms or complications of polycythaemia they have, or for any underlying cause of the condition.\nFor example, you may be given medicine to help relieve itching or manage COPD. Read more about:\n- treatments for itching\n- treating COPD"}, {"Lifestyle changes that help": "As well as improving some cases of apparent polycythaemia, making healthy lifestyle changes can also reduce the risk of potentially serious blood clots for people with all types of polycythaemia.\nHaving polycythaemia means you're already at high risk of a blood clot, and being overweight or smoking only increases this risk.\nYou may find the following advice and information helpful:\n- losing weight\n- BMI healthy weight calculator\n- preventing cardiovascular disease\n- managing high blood pressure\n- stopping smoking"}, {"Outlook for polycythaemia": "The outlook for polycythaemia largely depends on the underlying cause.\nMany cases are mild and may not lead to any further complications. However, some cases \u2013 particularly cases of PV \u2013 can be more serious and require long-term treatment.\nIf well controlled, polycythaemia should not affect your life expectancy, and you should be able to live a normal life. However, people with PV can have a slightly lower life expectancy than normal due to the increased risk of problems, such as heart attacks and strokes.\nPV can also sometimes cause scarring of the bone marrow (myelofibrosis), which can eventually lead to you having too few blood cells. In some rare cases, it can develop into a type of cancer called acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)."}]}, {"condition": "Polyhydramnios (too much amniotic fluid)", "sections": [{"No header": "Polyhydramnios is where there is too much amniotic fluid around the baby during pregnancy.

This means doctors may identify a variation in a gene, but not know what effect it may have.\nA positive result may cause permanent anxiety. Some people would rather not know about their risk and only want to be told if they actually develop cancer."}, {"What\u00a0testing involves": "There are usually 2 steps to genetic testing:\n- A relative with cancer has a diagnostic blood test to see if they have a cancer risk gene (this must happen before any healthy relatives are tested). Their result will be ready 6 to 8 weeks later.\n- If your relative's test is positive, you can have the predictive genetic test to see if you have the same faulty gene. Your GP will refer you to a local genetics service for a blood test (you'll need a copy of your relative's test results). The result will usually take up to 2 - 4 weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken, but this may not happen at your first appointment. This test is very likely to find the faulty gene but on rare occasions it may miss it.\nWhen there are no affected relatives available, full testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be possible for those with at least a 10% chance of having a faulty gene. This usually means having a very strong family history of early onset breast and particularly ovarian cancer. It can take 4 to 8 weeks or longer to get the result."}, {"What\u00a0a positive result means": "If your predictive genetic test result is positive, it means you have a faulty gene that raises your risk of developing cancer.\nIt does not mean you are guaranteed to get cancer \u2013 your genes only partly influence your future health risks. Other factors, such as your medical history, lifestyle and your environment, also play a role.\nIf you have one of the faulty BRCA genes, there is a 50% chance you will pass this on to any children you have and a 50% chance that each of your siblings also has it.\nYou may want to discuss your results with other members of your family, who may also be affected. Staff at the genetics clinic will discuss with you how a positive or negative result will affect your life and your relationships with your family.\nYou can read more about BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 866kb) produced by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\nInsurance companies cannot ask you to disclose the results of predictive genetic tests for the majority of policies, but this may change in the future."}, {"Managing your risk": "If your test result is positive, you have a range of options to manage your risk. Risk-reducing surgery is not the only option.\nUltimately, there's no right or wrong answer about what you should do \u2013 it's a decision only you can make.\nIf you have the faulty BRCA1/2 gene, it's a good idea to be aware of changes in your breasts. Find out more about being breast cancer aware.\nThis advice applies to men with a faulty BRCA2 gene too, as they are also at increased risk of breast cancer (although to a lesser extent).\nIn the case of breast cancer, annual breast screening in the form of mammograms and MRI scans can also monitor your condition and catch cancer early, if it does develop.\nDetecting breast cancer at an early stage means it may be easier to treat. The chance of making a full recovery from breast cancer, especially if it is detected early, is relatively high compared with other forms of cancer.\nUnfortunately, there's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer or prostate cancer. Read more about screening for prostate cancer. However, annual PSA tests for prostate cancer may benefit men who carry the faulty BRCA2 gene.\nChanges in your lifestyle can sometimes reduce your individual cancer risk. These include taking plenty of exercise and eating a healthy diet.\nIf you have a faulty BRCA gene, be aware of other factors that could increase your risk of breast cancer. It's recommended that you avoid:\n- theoral contraceptive pill\n- combinedhormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n- drinking more than the maximum recommended daily limits of alcohol\n- being overweight\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer breastfeed their children, if possible.\nFind out more about things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.\nNICE recommends medicines called tamoxifen, raloxifene and anastrozole for some women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer.\nThese can reduce your risk of getting breast cancer for many years.\nFind out more about medicine to prevent breast cancer.\nRisk-reducing surgery means removing all the tissue (such as the breasts or ovaries) that could become cancerous. Carriers of a faulty BRCA gene may wish to consider a preventative mastectomy.  \nWomen who have risk-reducing mastectomies reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by around 50%. However, a mastectomy is a major operation and recovering from it can be physically and emotionally difficult.\nSurgery can also be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk. Women who have their ovaries removed before the menopause not only dramatically reduce their chances of developing ovarian cancer, but also reduce their chances of developing breast cancer by up to 50%. However, this will trigger an early menopause and mean you're not able to have your own children (unless you store eggs or embryos). Read more about surgery to remove the ovaries, including the risks and after-effects.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry a BRCA gene fault does not begin to rise significantly until about the age of 40. Therefore, carriers of the faulty gene who are younger than 40 usually wait to have this operation."}, {"Telling\u00a0close relatives": "Your genetics unit will not approach your relatives about your result \u2013 it will usually be up to you to tell your family.\nYou may be given a standard letter to share with relatives, which explains your test result and contains all the information they need to be referred for the test themselves.\nHowever, not everyone will want to have the genetic test. Women who are closely related to you (such as your sister or daughter) can have cancer screening without having genetic testing."}, {"Planning a family": "Cancer risk genes can be passed on to any children you have. If your predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, you have several options. You can:\n- have your children without any intervention, and risk your child inheriting the faulty gene\n- adopt a baby\n- use donor eggs or donor sperm (depending on who carries the faulty gene) to avoid passing on the faulty gene\n- discuss prenatal testing with your doctor \u2013 but testing an unborn baby for genes that may cause cancer in later life, using CVS or amniocentesis, is not routinely offered\n- have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis \u2013 a technique used to select embryos that have not inherited the faulty gene; but there's no guarantee this technique will result in a successful pregnancy, and NHS funding for it may not be available to all patients"}, {"Paying\u00a0for private testing": "If there is not a strong family history of cancer in your family and the faulty gene has not otherwise been identified in any of your relatives, you will not be eligible for the NHS genetic test.\nYou'll have to pay for it privately if you still wish to have the test. Consider this carefully, because:\n- if you do not have any family history of cancer, it's less likely you have one of the faulty genes\n- the tests can be expensive, potentially costing around \u00a31,000 or more\n- there's no guarantee they will predict whether you'll develop cancer\n- you may not be offeredgenetic counsellingto help you make a decision and support you once you get your results"}, {"About BRCA1 and BRCA2": "If you have a fault (mutation) in one of the BRCA genes, your risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer is greatly increased.  \nWomen with the faulty BRCA1 gene, for example, have a 65 to 79% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 36 to 53% risk of ovarian cancer before the age of 80. In other words, out of every 100 women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, between 65 and 79 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and between 36 and 53 will develop ovarian cancer.\nThe faulty BRCA genes affect around 1 in every 300 to 400 people, but people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at a much higher risk (as many as 1 in 40 may carry the faulty gene).\nFor more information, read The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust beginners guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 on their website."}]}, {"condition": "Premature ejaculation, see Ejaculation problems", "sections": [{"No header": "Ejaculation problems are common sexual problems in men.\nThe 3 main types of ejacualtion problems are:\n- premature ejaculation\n- delayed ejaculation\n- retrograde ejaculation\nIf you have a persistent problem with ejaculation, visit your GP, who will discuss the problem with you and may examine you or refer you to a specialist."}, {"Premature ejaculation": "Premature ejaculation is the most common ejaculation problem. It's where the male ejaculates too quickly during sexual intercourse.\nA study looking at 500 couples from 5 different countries found the average time taken to ejaculate during intercourse was around 5-and-a-half minutes. However, it's up to each couple to decide if they\u2019re happy with the time taken \u2013 there's no definition of how long sex should last.\nOccasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. However, if you're finding that around half of your attempts at sex result in premature ejaculation, it might help to get treatment.\nVarious psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation.\nCommon physical causes include:\n- prostate problems\n- thyroid problems\u2013 anoveractiveorunderactive thyroid gland\n- using recreational drugs\nCommon psychological causes include:\n- depression\n- stress\n- relationship problems\n- anxiety about sexual performance(particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance)\nIt's possible, but less common, for a man to have always experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are:\n- conditioning\u2013 it's possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit\n- a traumatic sexual experiencefrom childhood\u2013 this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse\n- a strict upbringing and beliefs about sex\n- biological reasons\u2013 some men may find their penis is extra sensitive\nThere are a number of things you can try yourself before seeking medical help.\nIt can sometimes help to:\n- masturbate an hour or 2 before having sex\n- use a thick condom to help decrease sensation\n- take a deep breath to briefly shut down the ejaculatory reflex (an automatic reflex of the body during which ejaculation occurs)\n- have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating)\n- take breaks during sex and think about something boring\nIf you're in a long-term relationship, you may benefit from having couples therapy. During these sessions, the therapist will:\n- encourage couples to explore any relationship issues they have, and give them advice about resolving them\n- show the couple techniques that can help you \"unlearn\" the habit of premature ejaculation (the 2 most popular techniques are the \"squeeze\" and \"stop-go\" techniques)\nIn the squeeze technique, your partner masturbates you, but stops before the point of ejaculation and squeezes the head of your penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. They then let go and wait for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur.\nThe stop-go technique is similar, but your partner does not squeeze your penis. Once you feel more confident about delaying ejaculation, you and your partner can begin to have sex, stopping and starting as required.\nThese techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are designed to treat depression, but they also delay ejaculation. SSRIs used for this purpose include:\n- paroxetine\n- sertraline\n- fluoxetine\nSome men may experience an improvement as soon as treatment begins. However, you'll usually need to take the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks before you notice the full effects.\nSide effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after 2 to 3 weeks. They include:\n- fatigue\n- feeling sick and being sick\n- diarrhoea\n- excessive sweating\nRead more about the side effects of SSRIs.\nAn SSRI specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation, known as dapoxetine (Priligy), has now been licensed in the UK. Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS.\nIt acts much faster than the SSRIs mentioned above and can be used \"on demand\". You\u2019ll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day.\nYour response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6), and again every 6 months.\nDapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medicines, such as other antidepressants.\nCommon side effects include:\n- headaches\n- dizziness\n- feeling sick\nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), are a class of medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. Research has found that they may also help with premature ejaculation.\nBecause of changes in regulations, you no longer need a prescription to get sildenafil. But you will have to have a consultation with the pharmacist to make sure it's safe for you to take it.\nRead more about sildenafil including information on how and when to take it.\nThe use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation. Condoms can also be used and are effective, particularly when combined with local anaesthesia."}, {"Delayed ejaculation": "Delayed ejaculation (male orgasmic disorder) is classed as either:\n- experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation\n- being unable to ejaculate at all, even though the man wants to and his erection is normal\nYou may have delayed ejaculation if:\n- you experience a repeated and unwanted delay before ejaculation lasting for 30 to 60 minutes\n- you're unable to ejaculate at least half the times you have sex\nLike premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation can be caused by psychological and physical factors.\nPossible psychological causes of delayed ejaculation are similar to those of premature ejaculation \u2013 for example, early sexual trauma, strict upbringing, relationship problems, stress or depression.\nPhysical causes of delayed ejaculation include:\n- diabetes(usually onlytype 1 diabetes)\n- spinal cord injuries\n- multiple sclerosis\n- surgery to the bladder or prostate gland\n- increasing age\nMany medicines are known to cause delayed ejaculation, including:\n- antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs)\n- medicines to treat high blood pressure, such asbeta-blockers\n- antipsychotics, used to treat episodes of psychosis\n- muscle relaxantssuch as baclofen, which is widely used to treat motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis\n- powerful painkillers, such as methadone (which is also widely used to treat people addicted to heroin)\nDelayed ejaculation can suddenly start to happen after previously having no problems, or (less commonly) the man may have always experienced it.\nIt can occur in all sexual situations, or only in certain situations. For example, you may be able to ejaculate normally when masturbating, but not during sex. When ejaculation only occurs in certain situations, there's usually a psychological cause.\nSex therapy is a form of counselling that uses a combination of psychotherapy and structured changes in your sex life. This can help to increase your feeling of enjoyment during sex, and help make ejaculation easier.\nSome clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) provide a sex therapy service on the NHS. Availability can vary widely depending on where you live.\nYou can also pay privately. Prices per session are around \u00a350 to \u00a380. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists website provides information about private sex therapists and how to find a therapist in your local area.\nThe relationship counselling service Relate also offers sex therapy at a number of its centres. You'll need to pay for each session. \nDuring sex therapy, you'll have the opportunity to discuss any emotional or psychological issues related to your sexuality and relationship, in a non-judgemental way.\nActivities may also be recommended for you to try at home while you're having sex with your partner (you should never be asked to take part in any sexual activities during a session with the therapist).\nThese may include:\n- viewing erotic videos and magazines before having sex to increase the feeling of stimulation\n- erotic fantasies and \"sex games\" to make your lovemaking more exciting\n- using lubricating creams, or jellies, to make the physical act of sex more comfortable and relaxing\n- using sexual aids, such as vibrators, to increase pleasure\nRead more information about what a sex therapist can do.\nThere are a number of medicines that can be used if it's thought SSRIs are responsible for causing delayed ejaculation. These include:\n- amantadine\u2013 originally designed to treat viral infections\n- bupropion\u2013 usually prescribed to help people quit smoking\n- yohimbine\u2013 originally designed to treat erectile dysfunction\nThese help block some of the chemical effects of SSRIs that may contribute towards delayed ejaculation.\nAlcohol misuse and drug use can be separate underlying causes of delayed ejaculation, so addressing these problems may help.\nRead more about getting help with alcohol misuse and drug use.\nPseudoephedrine tablets may be tried, but these will need to be prescribed \"off-label\". This means the medicine shows promise in treating delayed ejaculation but it has not been licensed for this particular use (pseudoephedrine is normally used as a decongestant)."}, {"Retrograde ejaculation": "Retrograde ejaculation is a rarer type of ejaculation problem. It happens when semen travels backwards into the bladder instead of through the urethra (the tube that urine passes through).\nThe main symptoms of retrograde ejaculation include:\n- producing no semen, or only a small amount, during ejaculation\n- producing cloudy urine(because of the semen in it) when you first go to the toilet after having sex\nMen with retrograde ejaculation still experience the feeling of an orgasm and the condition does not pose a danger to health. However, it can affect the ability to father a child.\nRetrograde ejaculation is caused by damage to the nerves or muscles that surround the neck of the bladder (the point where the urethra connects to the bladder).\nUsually when you ejaculate, semen is pushed out of your urethra. It is prevented from entering your bladder by the muscles around the neck of the bladder, which close tightly at the moment of orgasm.\nHowever, damage to the surrounding muscles or nerves can stop the bladder neck closing, causing the semen to move into the bladder rather than up through the urethra.\nProstate gland surgery or bladder surgery is the most common cause of retrograde ejaculation. Other causes are diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\nMost men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health.\nBut if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try.\nFor example, pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery.\nIf retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medicine, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medicine is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medicine.\nHowever, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible.\nMen who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)."}, {"Involve your partner": "If you're having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible.\nCommunicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them.

The doctor will try to reduce the risk by prescribing the lowest dose necessary to control your symptoms, for the shortest time possible.\nStomach problems, such as stomach aches, indigestion and stomach ulcers are possible side effects of NSAIDs.\nA medicine called a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) will often be prescribed alongside NSAIDs to help protect your stomach by reducing the amount of acid it produces.\nRead more about the side effects of NSAIDs.\nIf NSAIDs alone are not helpful, some other medicines may be recommended.\nLike NSAIDs, corticosteroids can help reduce pain and swelling.\nIf you have a single inflamed or swollen joint, the doctor may inject the medicine directly into the joint. This can provide fast relief with minimal side effects, and the effect can last from a few weeks to several months.\nCorticosteroids can also be taken as a tablet, or an injection into the muscle, to help lots of joints. But doctors are usually cautious about this because the medicine can cause significant side effects if used for a long time, and psoriasis can flare up when you stop using it.\nDisease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) are medicines that block the effects of the chemicals released when your immune system attacks your joints.\nThey can help ease your symptoms and slow the progression of psoriatic arthritis. The earlier you start taking a DMARD, the more effective it will be.\nLeflunomide is often the first medicine given for psoriatic arthritis, although sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be considered as alternatives.\nIt can take several weeks or months to notice a DMARD working, so it's important to keep taking the medicine, even if it does not seem to be working at first.\nBiological treatments are a newer type of treatment for psoriatic arthritis. You may be offered one of these treatments if DMARDs have not worked or are not suitable.\nBiological treatments work by stopping particular chemicals in the blood activating the immune system to attack the lining of the joints.\nSome of the biological medicines that might be recommended are adalimumab, apremilast, certolizumab, etanercept and tofacitinib.\nThe most common side effect of biological treatments is a reaction in the area where the medicine is injected, such as redness, swelling or pain. These reactions are not usually serious.\nBiological treatments can also sometimes cause other side effects, including problems with your liver, kidneys or blood count. You'll usually need to have regular blood or urine tests to check for these.\nBiological treatments can also make you more likely to develop infections. Tell a doctor as soon as possible if you develop symptoms such as a sore throat, high temperature or diarrhoea.\nBiological medicine will usually be recommended for around 3 months to see if it helps.

They need human blood to survive, so will only leave the body to move from one person to another.\nThe most common way pubic lice are spread is through sexual contact, including vaginal, anal and oral sex.\nUsing condoms and other methods of barrier contraception doesn't protect you against pubic lice.\nOther types of close bodily contact, such as hugging and kissing, can also spread the lice.\nIt's also possible \u2013 though much rarer \u2013 for pubic lice to be spread through sharing clothes, towels and bedding."}, {"Treating pubic lice": "Pubic lice can be treated at home with insecticide cream, lotion or shampoo.\nYour GP or pharmacist can advise you about which treatment to use and how to use it. It's important to follow this advice.\nSome treatments only need to be applied to the affected area, but sometimes the whole body must be treated, taking care to avoid the eyes.\nThe treatment usually needs to be repeated 7 days later to get rid of any lice that have hatched during that time.\nIf the treatment doesn't work, you may need to use another type. This is because pubic lice can develop resistance to some treatments.\nYour GP or pharmacist will be able to advise you about suitable alternatives.\nTo prevent reinfestation, anyone you have had close bodily contact with, including any sexual partners you have had in the past 3 months, should also be treated, even if they don't have symptoms.\nCertain groups, such as young people under 18 years of age and pregnant or breastfeeding women, may require a specific type of treatment. \nAsk your GP or pharmacist for further advice about this.\nIn most cases the instructions for using a lotion, cream or shampoo will be as follows:\n- apply the product to the affected area, such as your eyebrows, beard or moustache \u2013 depending on the product, you might need to apply it to your whole body, including the scalp, neck, ears and face\n- be careful not to get the product in your eyes \u2013 if you do, rinse your eyes thoroughly with water\n- reapply the treatment if you wash any part of your body during the treatment time\n- after the treatment time (stated on the packet) has passed, wash the lotion or cream off\n- repeat the treatment as instructed, usually after 7 days\nDon't use the medication more than twice. If you think it hasn't worked, see your GP or pharmacist for advice.\nInsecticides used to treat pubic lice may cause skin irritation, such as itchiness, redness, stinging or burning.\nIf you have skin irritation, wash the insecticide off the affected area.\nSome aqueous and alcohol-based medications may discolour permed, coloured or bleached hair. Check the patient information leaflet.\nThe first treatment application will probably kill the lice, but the eggs may not have been destroyed. This means more lice could hatch and the cycle will start again.\nReapplying the treatment after 7 days will ensure that any lice are killed before they're old enough to lay more eggs.\nCheck for lice 1 week after your second treatment, or return to your GP, practice nurse or sexual health clinic so they can check for you.\nFinding empty eggshells (dead nits) doesn't necessarily mean you're still infested as they can remain stuck to the hairs even after treatment.\nEyelash infestations are rare. If your eyelashes are infested, seek specialist advice from your doctor. They'll be able to recommend the correct treatment for you. \nYou can't use the same insecticide lotion or cream that's used on your body because it'll irritate your eyes. \nMake sure you follow the treatment instructions carefully.\nWash clothing, towels and bedding in a washing machine. This should be on a hot cycle (50C or higher) to ensure the lice are killed and to prevent reinfection."}, {"Complications of pubic lice": "Sometimes a pubic lice infestation can lead to minor complications, such as skin or eye problems.\nScratching can irritate your skin, or it could lead to an infection such as impetigo (a bacterial skin infection) or furunculosis (boils on the skin).\nEye infections, such as conjunctivitis, and eye inflammation, such as blepharitis, can sometimes develop if your eyelashes have been infested with pubic lice.\nYou may also have a mild fever or feel tired and run down.\nSeek medical advice if you have severe skin irritation or sore eyes."}, {"Sexual health advice": "You can call the Department of Health's sexual health helpline on 0300 123 7123 for confidential advice and support 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nIf you're under 25, you can also contact an adviser at Brook using their text and webchat service.\nThey provide free and confidential information and advice about STIs, contraception, pregnancy, plus other sexual health matters."}]}, {"condition": "Pudendal neuralgia", "sections": [{"No header": "Pudendal neuralgia is long-term pelvic pain that originates from damage or irritation of the pudendal nerve \u2013 a main nerve in the pelvis.\nThe pudendal nerve supplies areas including the:\n- lower buttocks\n- area between the buttocks and genitals (perineum)\n- area around the anus and rectum\n- vulva, labia and clitoris in women\n- scrotum and penis in men\nPudendal neuralgia can be very uncomfortable and distressing, but help is available."}, {"Symptoms\u00a0of pudendal neuralgia": "The main symptom of pudendal neuralgia is pelvic pain.
