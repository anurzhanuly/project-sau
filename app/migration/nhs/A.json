If you use tissues to wipe any pus away from your abscess, dispose of them straight away to avoid germs spreading. Wash your hands after you've disposed of the tissues.\nTake care when shaving your face, legs, underarm areas or bikini area to avoid nicking your skin. Do not share razors or toothbrushes.\nIt may also help to reduce your risk of skin abscesses by:\n- maintaining a healthy, balanced diet\n- losing weightif you're overweight or obese\n- stopping smoking\nIt's difficult to prevent internal abscesses, as they're often complications of other conditions."}, {"Other types of abscess": "There are many other types of abscess not fully covered here, including:\n- an anorectal abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus inside the bottom (the rectum and anus)\n- aBartholin's cyst\u2013 a build-up of pus inside one of the Bartholin's glands, which are found on each side of the opening of the vagina\n- abrain abscess\u2013 a rare but potentially life-threatening build-up of pus inside the skull\n- adental abscess\u2013 a build-up of pus under a tooth or in the supporting gum and bone\n- a quinsy (peritonsillar abscess) \u2013 a build-up of pus between one of the tonsils and the wall of the throat\n- apilonidal abscess\u2013 a build-up of pus in the skin of the cleft of the buttocks (where the buttocks separate)\n- a spinal cord abscess \u2013 a build-up of pus around the spinal cord"}]}, {"condition": "Acanthosis nigricans", "sections": [{"No header": "Acanthosis nigricans is the name for dry, dark patches of skin that usually appear in the armpits, neck or groin.

It may also be associated with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs.\nIn rare cases, achalasia may run in families."}, {"Diagnosing achalasia": "If a GP thinks you have achalasia, you'll be referred to hospital to have some diagnostic tests.

The barium shows up clearly on X-ray so the doctor can see how long it takes to move into your stomach.\n- Endoscopy\u2013 a thin, flexible instrument called an endoscope is passed down your throat to allow the doctor to look directly at the lining of your oesophagus, the ring of muscle and your stomach."}, {"Treatments for achalasia": "There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier.\nYour doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options.\nMedicines, such as nitrates or nifedipine, can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus. This makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although they do not work for everyone.\nThe effect only lasts for a short time, so medicine may be used to ease symptoms while you wait for a more permanent treatment. They may cause headaches, but this usually improves over time.\nUnder a sedative or general anaesthetic, a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube (endoscope). The balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach.\nThis improves swallowing for most people, but you may need treatment several times before your symptoms improve.\nBalloon dilatation does carry a small risk of tearing the oesophagus (oesophageal rupture), which may require emergency surgery.\nUsing an endoscope, botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax.\nIt is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated. This is usually painless, and can be used for temporary relief in people who are not able to have other treatments.\nUnder general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut. This is done using keyhole surgery (laparoscopy) and is called Heller's Myotomy.\nIt can permanently make swallowing easier.\nOften a second procedure will be done at the same time to stop you getting acid reflux and heartburn, which can be a side effect of the Heller's Myotomy operation. Your surgeon will talk to you about this.\nIn rare cases some people may need an operation to remove part of their oesophagus.\nBalloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. A GP may be able to prescribe medicine to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medicine routinely.\nIt's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment.

For example, you may get headaches and vision problems if a tumour pushes against the nearby nerves.\nAcromegaly sometimes runs in families, but most of the time it's not inherited. Adenomas usually spontaneously develop because of a genetic change in a cell of the pituitary gland.

It may also be linked to some genetic conditions."}, {"Treating acromegaly": "Treatment for acromegaly depends on your symptoms. Usually the goal is to:\n- reduce growth hormone production to normal levels\n- relieve the pressure a tumour may be putting on surrounding tissues\n- treat any hormone deficiencies\n- improve your symptoms\nMost people with acromegaly have surgery to remove a pituitary tumour. Medicine or radiotherapy may sometimes be needed after, or instead of, surgery.\nSurgery is usually effective and can completely cure acromegaly. But sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed entirely, and you may need another operation or further treatment with medicine or radiotherapy.\nUnder general anaesthetic, the surgeon will make a small cut inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the pituitary gland.\nA long, thin, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end, called an endoscope, is fed into the opening so your doctor can see the tumour. Surgical instruments are passed through the same opening and used to remove the tumour.\nRemoving the tumour should instantly lower your levels of growth hormone and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissue. Facial features often start to return to normal and swelling improves within a few days.\nWith surgery, there's risk of:\n- damaging the healthy parts of your pituitary gland\n- leakage of the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain\n- meningitis\u2013 although this is rare\nYour surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have.\nMedicine may be prescribed if your growth hormone levels are still higher than normal after surgery, or if surgery was not possible.\n3 different types of medicine are used:\n- a monthly injection of either octreotide, lanreotide or pasireotide\u2013 this slows down the release of growth hormone and can sometimes also shrink tumours\n- a daily pegvisomant injection\u2013 this blocks the effects of growth hormone and can significantly improve symptoms\n- bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets\u2013 these can stop growth hormone being produced, but they only work in a small proportion of people\nEach of these medicines has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you, and the benefits and risks of each.\nIf surgery is not possible, or not all of the tumour could be removed, or if medicine has not worked, you may be offered radiotherapy.\nThis can eventually reduce your growth hormone levels, but it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medicine in the meantime.\n2 main types of radiotherapy are used to treat acromegaly:\n- stereotactic radiotherapy\u2013 a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you'll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment, which can usually be done in one session\n- conventional radiotherapy\u2013 this also uses a beam of radiation to target the adenoma, but it's wider and less precise than the one used in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so it's given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to give your tissues time to heal between treatments\nStereotactic radiotherapy is more commonly used to treat adenomas because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nRadiotherapy can have a number of side effects. It will often cause a gradual drop in the levels of other hormones produced by your pituitary gland, so you'll usually need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. It may also have an effect on your fertility.\nYour doctor will be able to talk to you about these risks and other possible side effects.\nTreatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving the symptoms of acromegaly.\nAfter treatment, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor how well your pituitary gland is working, check you're on the correct hormone replacement treatment and make sure the condition does not return."}, {"Diagnosing acromegaly": "Because the symptoms of acromegaly often develop gradually over several years, you may not get a diagnosis straight away. Your doctor may ask you to bring in photographs of yourself that span the past few years to look for the tell-tale gradual changes.\nIf your doctor suspects you have acromegaly, you'll need to have a blood test to measure your growth hormone levels.\nTo make sure the blood test gives an accurate result, you may be asked to drink a sugary solution before having a series of blood samples taken. For people without acromegaly, drinking the solution should stop growth hormone being released. In people with acromegaly, the level of growth hormone in the blood will remain high. This is called a glucose tolerance test.\nYour doctor will also measure the level of another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). A higher level of IGF-1 is a very accurate indication that you may have acromegaly.\nIf your blood tests show a high level of growth hormone and IGF-1, you might have an MRI scan of your brain.

It involves stimulating sensory nerves under the skin and in the muscles.\nThis results in the body producing natural substances, such as pain-relieving endorphins. It's likely that these naturally released substances are responsible for the beneficial effects experienced with acupuncture.\nA course of acupuncture usually creates longer lasting pain relief than when a single treatment is used.\nTraditional acupuncture is based on the belief that an energy, or \"life force\", flows through the body in channels called meridians. This life force is known as Qi (pronounced \"chee\").\nPractitioners who use acupuncture in the traditional way believe that when Qi does not flow freely through the body, this can cause illness.

You may also be asked to remove some clothes so the practitioner can access certain parts of your body.\nThe needles used are very fine and are usually a few centimetres long. They should be single-use, pre-sterilised needles that are disposed of immediately after use.\nAcupuncture practitioners choose specific points to place the needles based on your condition. Several points may be used during a typical session, depending on the number of symptoms you have.\nThe needles may be inserted just under the skin, or deeper so they reach muscle. Once the needles are in place, they may be left in position for a length of time lasting from a few minutes up to around 30 minutes.\nYou may feel a tingling or a dull ache when the needles are inserted but you should not experience any significant pain.

Your child will usually be given painkillers while in hospital to help ease discomfort.\nYour child may also feel groggy and sleepy after having an anaesthetic. After the operation, they'll be checked for several hours to make sure they're recovering normally. Once the doctor is satisfied, you'll be able to take your child home.\nAfter an adenoidectomy, some children have some minor health problems. However, most of these are temporary and rarely require further treatment. They can include:\n- sore throat\n- earache\n- stiff jaw\n- blocked nose or nasal discharge\n- bad breath\n- a change in voice (your child may sound like they're speaking through their nose)\n- finding it hard to swallow\n- finding it hard to brush their teeth\nMost of these symptoms will pass within a few weeks. Contact your GP if your child is still affected after a few weeks.\nYour child may need painkillers for a few days after the operation.\nOver-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol, are usually suitable. Younger children may find it easier to take liquid or soluble paracetamol, particularly if they have a sore throat.\nAlways make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the packet, and never give aspirin to a child who's under the age of 16.\nYour child should start eating normally as soon as possible.\nGiving your child a dose of painkillers about an hour or so before they eat may make swallowing food easier.\nIt's also important for them to drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.\nYour child will need to rest for several days after an adenoidectomy and should be kept off school for about 10 days.

If you stop drinking alcohol for 2 weeks, your liver should return to normal.\nAlcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis, is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period.\nWhen this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol.\nLess commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking).\nThe liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness.\nMany people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.\nCirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.\nIt's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.\nA person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and does not stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5 more years."}, {"Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD)": "There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD.

They'll use their hands to gently guide you in your movements, help you maintain a better relationship between your head, neck and spine, and to release muscle tension.\nYou'll need to attend a number of lessons to learn the basic concepts of the Alexander technique. Often, around 20 or more weekly lessons are recommended.\nTeachers of the technique say you may see an improvement in aches and pains fairly soon after starting the lessons, but that you need to be committed to putting what you learn into practice and it may take a considerable amount of time to see the full benefits.\nThe overall aim is to help you gain an understanding of the main principles involved so you can apply them to everyday life, allowing you to benefit from the technique without the need for frequent ongoing lessons."}, {"Does the Alexander technique work?": "Supporters of the Alexander technique often claim it can help people with a wide range of health conditions.

But in alkaptonuria a substance produced along the way, homogentisic acid, cannot be broken down any further.\nThis is because the enzyme that normally breaks it down does not work properly. Enzymes are proteins that make chemical reactions happen.\nOne of the earliest signs of the condition is dark-stained nappies, as homogentisic acid causes urine to turn black when exposed to air for a few hours.\nIf this sign is missed or overlooked in a baby or child, the disorder may go unnoticed until adulthood, as there are usually no other noticeable symptoms until the person reaches their late 20s to early 30s."}, {"Signs and symptoms in adults": "Over the course of many years, homogentisic acid slowly builds up in tissues throughout the body.\nIt can build up in almost any area of the body, including the cartilage, tendons, bones, nails, ears and heart. It stains the tissues dark and causes a wide range of problems.\nWhen a person with alkaptonuria reaches their 30s, they may start to experience joint problems.\nTypically, they'll have lower back pain and stiffness, followed by knee, hip and shoulder pain. These are the early symptoms of osteoarthritis. \nEventually, cartilage \u2013 a tough, flexible tissue found throughout the body \u2013 may become brittle and break, leading to joint and spinal damage. Joint replacement operations may be needed.\nMany people develop brown or grey spots on the whites of their eyes.\nAnother sign in many adults with alkaptonuria is thickening of ear cartilage. The cartilage may also look blue, grey or black. This is called ochronosis.\nThe earwax may be black or reddish-brown.\nAlkaptonuria can result in discoloured sweat, which can stain clothes and cause some people to have blue or black speckled areas of skin. Nails may also turn a bluish or brownish colour.\nThe skin colour changes are most obvious on areas exposed to the sun and where sweat glands are found \u2013 the cheeks, forehead, armpits and genital area.\nIf the bones and muscles around the lungs become stiff, it can prevent the chest expanding and lead to shortness of breath or difficulty breathing.\nDeposits of homogentisic acid around heart valves can cause them to harden and turn brittle and black. Blood vessels can also become stiff and weaken.\nThis can lead to heart disease and may require heart valve replacements.\nThe deposits can also lead to kidney stones, bladder stones and prostate stones."}, {"How alkaptonuria is inherited": "Each cell in the body contains 23 pairs of chromosomes. These carry the genes you inherit from your parents.\nOne of each pair of chromosomes is inherited from each parent, which means (with the exception of the sex chromosomes) there are two copies of each gene in each cell.\nThe gene involved in alkaptonuria is the HGD gene. This provides instructions for making an enzyme called homogentisate oxidase, which is needed to break down homogentisic acid.\nYou need to inherit two copies of the faulty HGD gene (one from each parent) to develop alkaptonuria. The chances of this are slim, which is why the condition is very rare.\nThe parents of a person with alkaptonuria will often only carry one copy of the faulty gene themselves, which means they will not have any signs or symptoms of the condition."}, {"How alkaptonuria is managed": "Alkaptonuria is a lifelong condition \u2013 there's currently no specific treatment or cure.\nHowever, a medicine called nitisinone has shown some promise, and painkillers and lifestyle changes may help you cope with the symptoms.\nNitisinone is not licensed for alkaptonuria \u2013 it's offered \"off label\" at the National Alkaptonuria Centre, the treatment centre for all alkaptonuria patients, based at Royal Liverpool University Hospital.\nNitisinone reduces the level of homogentisic acid in the body. Research into its effectiveness for alkaptonuria is ongoing and there have been some promising results so far.\nFind out about the National Alkaptonuria Centre and nitisinone treatment on the Alkaptonuria Society website\nIf the condition is diagnosed in childhood, it may be possible to slow its progression by restricting protein in the diet, as this may reduce levels of tyrosine and phenylalanine in your body.\nA low-protein diet can also be useful in reducing the risk of potential side effects when taking nitisinone for alkaptonuria during adulthood. Your doctor or dietitian can advise you about this.\nIf alkaptonuria causes pain and stiffness, you may think exercise will make your symptoms worse. But regular gentle exercise can actually help by building muscle and strengthening your joints.\nExercise is also good for relieving stress, losing weight and improving your posture, all of which can ease your symptoms.\nThe AKU Society recommends avoiding exercise that puts additional strain on the joints, such as boxing, football and rugby, and trying gentle exercise such as yoga, swimming and pilates instead.\nYour GP or a physiotherapist can help you come up with a suitable exercise plan to follow at home.

The choice of anaesthetic can depend on what part of your body is being amputated.\nMost amputations involve removing a section of a limb rather than the entire limb.\nOnce the section of the limb has been amputated, additional techniques can be used to help improve the function of the remaining part of the limb and reduce the risk of complications.\nThese include shortening and smoothing the bone in the remaining section of the limb so it's covered by an adequate amount of soft tissue and muscle. The surgeon then stitches the muscle to the bones to help strengthen the remaining section (a technique known as myodesis).\nAfter the amputation, your wound will be sealed with stitches or surgical staples. It will be covered with a bandage and a tube may be placed under your skin to drain any excess fluid. The bandage will usually need to be kept in place for a few days to reduce the risk of infection."}, {"Recovering after an amputation": "After surgery, you'll usually be given oxygen through a mask and fluids through a drip for the first few days while you recover in a ward.\nA small flexible tube (urinary catheter)) may be placed in your bladder during surgery to drain urine.

This is normal and it may continue after you've been discharged.\nUsing a compression garment will help with swelling and the shape of the stump. It may also reduce phantom pain (pain that seems to be coming from your missing limb) and help support the limb.\nYou'll be fitted with a compression garment once your wound has healed. It should be worn every day, but taken off at bedtime. You should be given at least 2 garments, which should be washed regularly.\nPhysical rehabilitation is an important part of the recovery process. It can be a long, difficult and frustrating process, but it's important to persevere. After rehabilitation, you may be able to return to work and other activities.\nYour rehabilitation programme will be tailored to your individual needs and will aim to allow you to do as many of your normal activities as possible.\nYou'll work closely with physiotherapists and occupational therapists who will discuss with you what you'd like to achieve from rehabilitation so that some realistic goals can be set.\nYour rehabilitation programme will usually start a few days after your operation. It may begin with simple exercises you can do while lying down or sitting. If you've had a leg amputation, you'll be encouraged to move around as soon as possible using a wheelchair.\nYou'll also be taught \"transfer techniques\" to help you move around more easily, such as how to get into a wheelchair from your bed.\nOnce your wound has started to heal, you may start working on an exercise programme with a physiotherapist in the hospital to help you maintain your mobility and muscle strength.\nIf you have a prosthetic limb fitted, your physiotherapist will teach you how to use it. For example, how to walk on a prosthetic leg or grip with a prosthetic hand.\nThe length of time it will take before you're ready to go home will depend on the type of amputation you've had and your general state of health.\nBefore you're discharged from hospital, an occupational therapist may arrange to visit you at home to see if your home needs to be adapted to make it more accessible.\nFor example, you may need a wheelchair ramp or a stairlift.

Find out more about walking aids, wheelchairs and scooters and assessing your care and support needs.\nIt can take several months before you're fitted with a prosthetic limb (if you're suitable for a prosthesis), so you may be given a wheelchair to help you get around if you've had an amputation of a lower limb.\nYou'll probably need to attend a follow-up appointment a few weeks after you leave hospital, to discuss how you're coping at home and whether you need additional help, support or equipment.\nAt your appointment, you may also be given details of your nearest amputee support group, made up of both healthcare professionals and people living with an amputation."}, {"Prosthetic limbs": "After an amputation, you may be able to have a prosthetic limb fitted.\nProsthetic limbs are not suitable for everyone who's had an amputation because an extensive course of physiotherapy and rehabilitation is required.\nAdjusting to life with a prosthetic limb takes a considerable amount of energy because you have to compensate for the loss of muscle and bone in the amputated limb.\nThis is why frail people or those with a serious health condition, such as heart disease, may not be suitable for a prosthetic limb.\nIf you're able to have a prosthetic limb, the type of limb that's recommended for you will depend on:\n- the type of amputation you had\n- the amount of muscle strength in the remaining section of the limb\n- your general health\n- tasks the prosthetic limb will be expected to perform\n- whether you want the limb to look as real as possible or you're more concerned with function\nIf it's thought that you would find it difficult to withstand the strain of using a prosthetic limb, a cosmetic limb may be recommended. This is a limb that looks like a real limb, but it cannot be used like a prosthetic limb.\nIt's possible to have a prosthetic limb that's both physically realistic and functional, but there may have to be an element of compromise between the different types.\nIf a prosthetic limb is suitable for you, you'll begin a programme of activities while still in hospital to prepare for the prosthesis.\nBefore a prosthetic limb is fitted, the skin covering your stump may be made less sensitive (known as desensitisation). This will make the prosthesis more comfortable to wear.\nSkin desensitisation involves:\n- gently tapping the skin with a face cloth\n- using compression bandages to help reduce swelling and prevent a build-up of fluid inside and around the stump\n- rubbing and pulling the skin around your bone to prevent excessive scarring\nYour physiotherapist will teach you exercises to strengthen the muscles in your remaining limb and improve your general energy levels, so you're able to cope better with the demands of an artificial limb.\nDepending on what's available in your local area, it can be several months before you get your first appointment with a prosthetist."}, {"Stump care": "It's very important to keep the skin on the surface of your stump clean to reduce the risk of it becoming irritated or infected.\nGently wash your stump at least once a day (more frequently in hot weather) with mild unscented soap and warm water, and dry it carefully.\nIf you have a prosthetic limb, you should also regularly clean the socket using soap and warm water.\nWhen taking a bath, avoid leaving your stump submerged in water for long periods because the water will soften the skin on your stump, making it more vulnerable to injury.\nIf your skin becomes dry, use a moisturising cream before bedtime or when you're not wearing your prosthesis.\nSome people find wearing one or more socks around their stump helps absorb sweat and reduces skin irritation. The size of your stump may change as the swelling goes down, so the number of socks you need to use may vary. You should change the socks every day.\nCheck your stump carefully every day for signs of infection, such as:\n- warm, red and tender skin\n- discharge of fluid or pus\n- increasing swelling\nContact your care team for advice if you think you may be developing a skin infection.\nAfter having a leg or foot amputated, it's very important to avoid injuring your remaining \"good\" leg and foot, particularly if your amputation was needed because of diabetes. Your remaining leg and foot may also be at risk.\nAvoid wearing poorly fitting footwear and ensure that an appropriately trained healthcare professional, such as a podiatrist, is involved in the care of your remaining foot. You should also be offered a regular review of your foot by a foot care team.\nFind out more about diabetes and foot care."}, {"Complications": "Like any type of operation, an amputation carries a risk of complications. It also carries a risk of additional problems directly related to the loss of a limb.\nThere are a number of factors that influence the risk of complications from amputation, such as your age, the type of amputation you've had, and your general health.\nThe risk of serious complications is lower in planned amputations than in emergency amputations.\nComplications associated with having an amputation include:\n- heart problems such asheart attack\n- deep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n- slow wound healing and wound infection\n- pneumonia\n- stump and \"phantom limb\" pain\nIn some cases, further surgery may be needed to correct problems that develop or to help relieve pain. For example, if neuromas (thickened nerve tissue) are thought to be causing pain, the affected cluster of nerves may need to be removed.\nMany people who have an amputation experience some degree of stump pain or \"phantom limb\" pain.\nStump pain can have many different causes, including rubbing or sores where the stump touches a prosthetic limb, nerve damage during surgery and the development of neuromas.\nPhantom limb sensations are sensations that seem to be coming from the amputated limb. Occasionally, these can be painful (phantom limb pain).\nThe term \"phantom\" does not mean the sensations are imaginary. Phantom limb pain is a real phenomenon, which has been confirmed using brain imaging scans to study how nerve signals are transmitted to the brain.\nThe symptoms of phantom limb pain can range from mild to severe. Some people have described brief \"flashes\" of mild pain, similar to an electric shock, that last for a few seconds. Others have described constant severe pain.\nStump and phantom limb pain will usually improve over time, but treatments are available to help relieve the symptoms.\nMedicines that may be used to help relieve pain include:\n- non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such asibuprofen\n- anticonvulsants such ascarbamazepineorgabapentin\n- antidepressants such asamitriptyline, or nortriptyline, which are useful in treating nerve pain\n- opioids such ascodeineormorphine\n- corticosteroidorlocal anaestheticinjections\nThere are several non-invasive techniques that may help relieve pain in some people. They include: \n- adjusting the way your prosthesis fits to make it more comfortable.\n- applying heat or cold to your limb, such as using heat or ice packs, rubs and creams.\n- massage to increase circulation and stimulate muscles.\n- acupunctureis thought to stimulate the nervous system and relieve pain.\n- transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), which uses a small, battery-operated device to deliver electrical impulses to the affected area of your body, to block or reduce pain signals.\nResearch has shown that people who spend 40 minutes a day imagining using the part of their limb that was amputated, such as stretching out their \"fingers\" or bunching up their \"toes\", experience a reduction in pain symptoms.\nThis may be related to the central theory of phantom limb pain. Researchers think the brain looks to receive feedback from an amputated limb, and these mental exercises may provide an effective substitute for this missing feedback.\nAnother technique, known as mirror visual feedback, involves using a mirror to create a reflection of the other limb. Some people find that exercising and moving their other limb can help relieve phantom pain."}, {"Psychological impact of amputation": "The loss of a limb can have a considerable psychological impact. Many people who've had an amputation report emotions such as grief and bereavement, similar to experiencing the death of a loved one.\nComing to terms with the psychological impact of an amputation is therefore often as important as coping with the physical demands.\nHaving an amputation can have a considerable psychological impact for three main reasons:\n- you have to cope with the loss of sensation from your amputated limb.\n- you have to cope with the loss of function from your amputated limb.\n- your sense of body image, and other people's perception of your body image, has changed.\nNegative thoughts and emotions are common after an amputation. This is particularly true in people who've had an emergency amputation because they don't have time to mentally prepare for the effects of surgery.\nCommon emotions and thoughts experienced by people after an amputation include:\n- depression\n- anxiety\n- denial (refusing to accept they need to make changes, such as havingphysiotherapy, to adapt to life after an amputation)\n- grief\n- feelingsuicidal\nPeople who've had an amputation as a result of trauma (particularly members of the armed forces) also have an increased risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).\nTalk to your care team about your thoughts and feelings, particularly if you're feeling depressed or suicidal. You may need additional treatment, such as antidepressants or counselling, to improve your ability to cope after having an amputation."}, {"Help and support": "Being told you need to have a limb amputated can be a devastating and frightening experience. Adjusting to life after an amputation can be challenging, but many people enjoy a good quality of life once they have managed to adapt.\nThere are a number of charities that can provide advice and support for people living with amputations, which include:\n- The Limbless Association\n- Douglas Bader Foundation\n- Steel Bones\n- Amputation Foundation"}]}, {"condition": "Amyloidosis", "sections": [{"No header": "Amyloidosis is the name for a group of rare, serious conditions caused by a build-up of an abnormal protein called amyloid in organs and tissues throughout the body.\nThe build-up of amyloid proteins (deposits) can make it difficult for the organs and tissues to work properly.

This may result in heart failure, which can cause:\n- shortness of breath\n- oedema\n- an abnormal heartbeat(arrhythmia)\nAmyloid proteins can also build up in other areas, like the liver, spleen, nerves or digestive system. Symptoms can include:\n- feelinglightheadedorfainting, particularly after standing or sitting up\n- numbness or a tingling feeling in the hands and feet(peripheral neuropathy)\n- nausea,diarrhoeaorconstipation\n- numbness, tingling and pain in the wrist, hand and fingers(carpal tunnel syndrome)\n- easy bruising\nAL amyloidosis does not affect the brain, so it does not cause any problems with memory or thinking, for example.\nSee a GP if you have any of the above symptoms and are worried. The GP can prescribe treatments to help with these symptoms.\nIn some cases, AL amyloidosis can be linked to a type of bone cancer called multiple myeloma.\nThe charity Myeloma UK has more information on multiple myeloma and its link with AL amyloidosis."}, {"Cause of AL amyloidosis": "AL amyloidosis is caused by an abnormality in certain cells found in the bone marrow, called plasma cells.\nThe abnormal plasma cells produce abnormal forms of light chain proteins, which enter the bloodstream and can form amyloid deposits.\nHealthy people have normal light chain proteins in their blood that are part of their natural antibody proteins. These help protect the body from infection.\nThe abnormal light chains in patients with AL amyloidosis clump together into thread-like strings (amyloid fibrils) that the body cannot clear away easily.\nOver time, amyloid fibrils build up as AL amyloid deposits in tissues and organs. This gradually stops them functioning properly, causing the many symptoms of AL amyloidosis.\nUnlike some other types of amyloidosis, AL amyloidosis is not inherited, so a person with the condition cannot pass it on to their children."}, {"Treating AL amyloidosis": "There is not currently a cure for amyloidosis. The amyloid deposits cannot be directly removed.\nBut there are treatments to stop more of the abnormal proteins being produced and treat your symptoms.\nThese treatments can give your body time to gradually clear the deposits before they build up again. This can help prevent organ damage.\nIn most cases, the treatment will involve having chemotherapy. Chemotherapy damages abnormal bone marrow cells and stops them producing the abnormal proteins that form amyloid deposits.\nSteroids are usually given together with chemotherapy to boost the effect of the chemotherapy drugs. They may also lessen your chances of having a bad reaction to chemotherapy.\nYour doctor may also discuss using other treatments, such as a stem cell transplant.\nYou may also need special medicine if you have heart failure or kidney failure. \nYour doctors and nurses will need to carefully control the amount of salt you have and how much you drink. You may also need dialysis if you have end-stage kidney failure.\nSome people with kidney failure may be suitable for a kidney transplant. But the underlying problem with your bone marrow will still need to be treated using chemotherapy as this will prevent a build-up of amyloid in the new kidney.\nAfter chemotherapy, you'll need regular check-ups every 6 to 12 months to look for signs of the AL amyloidosis returning. If it does return, you may need to start chemotherapy again."}, {"Diagnosing AL amyloidosis": "Diagnosing AL amyloidosis can be hard, as the symptoms are often vague.\nA small tissue sample (a biopsy) can be taken from the affected part of your body. Your doctor will talk to you about how this will be done.\nThe biopsy will be examined under a microscope in a laboratory to see if there are any amyloid deposits in it.\nYou may also have other tests to assess how the amyloid deposits have affected your individual organs.\nFor example:\n- taking a sample of your bone marrow\n- a heart ultrasound scan (anechocardiogram) to check the condition of your heart\n- various differentblood teststo look for damage to your heart, kidneys or other organs\n- aCT scanorMRI scanto check the health of different organs in your body\nThe NHS National Amyloidosis Centre at the Royal Free Hospital in London also offers a type of body scan called an SAP scan.\nThis involves being injected with a small amount of a radio-labelled blood protein called serum amyloid P component (SAP). You are then scanned with a special camera that detects the radioactivity.\nThe radio-labelled protein sticks to any amyloid deposits in your body, so you can see the areas of your body that are affected."}, {"ATTR amyloidosis": "ATTR amyloidosis is a very rare condition caused by amyloid deposits from abnormal versions of a blood protein called transthyretin (TTR).\nATTR amyloidosis can run in families and is known as hereditary ATTR amyloidosis. People with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis carry mutations in the TTR gene.\nThis means their bodies produce abnormal TTR proteins throughout their lives, which can form amyloid deposits. These usually affect the nerves or the heart, or both.\nAnother type of ATTR amyloidosis is not hereditary. This is called wild-type ATTR amyloidosis, or senile systemic amyloidosis.\nIn this condition, the amyloid deposits mainly affect the heart and can also cause carpal tunnel syndrome in some people.\nHereditary ATTR amyloidosis may cause symptoms at any age from about 30 years old. The symptoms of wild-type ATTR amyloidosis usually only appear after around the age of 65.\nATTR amyloidosis can be diagnosed by:\n- taking a sample of the affected tissues (tissuebiopsy)\n- genetic testing\n- heart scans \u2013 such as anechocardiogram, a cardiacMRIor a special type of scan called a DPD\nMedicines used to treat ATTR include:\n- patisiran (Onpattro) \u2013 evidence shows that it reduces disability and improves quality of life. It may also stop and potentially reverse the disease\n- inotersen (Tegsedi) \u2013 evidence shows that it slows down progression of the illness\nSome types of inherited ATTR amyloidosis can be treated with a liver transplant.\nHeart failure can be treated by carefully controlling the amount of salt you have and how much you drink, and by taking drugs for heart failure. Heart transplantation may very rarely be an option."}, {"Information about you": "If you have amyloidosis, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.

This isn't true: taking anabolic steroids is a dangerous drug habit."}, {"How anabolic steroids are taken": "Anabolic steroids are usually injected into a muscle or taken by mouth as tablets, but they also come as creams or gels that are applied to the skin.\nMany people who use anabolic steroids are aware of the dangers of taking them, and believe that by taking the drugs in certain ways they can avoid side effects. Or they may take additional medicines to try to counter the side effects.\nUsers might:\n- Take the drugs for a period of time and then stop for a rest period before starting again. This is known as \"cycling\".\n- Take more than one type of anabolic steroid at a time, known as \"stacking\", which they believe makes the steroids work better.\n- Do a combination of both stacking and cycling, known as \"pyramiding\", where they start off taking a low dose of one or more anabolic steroids, and then increase the dose over time up to a maximum dose. They then stop taking them for a rest period to give the body a break before starting the cycle again.\nBut there is no evidence that any of these methods actually reduce side effects and harms from taking anabolic steroids.\nUsers tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time."}, {"Side effects of anabolic steroids": "Regularly taking anabolic steroids can lead to physical and psychological changes in both men and women, as well as potentially dangerous medical conditions.\nEffects of anabolic steroids in men can include:\n- reduced sperm count\n- infertility\n- shrunken testicles\n- erectile dysfunction\n- hair loss\n- breast development\n- increased risk ofprostate cancer\n- severeacne\n- stomach pain\nIn women, anabolic steroids can cause:\n- facial hair growth and body hair\n- loss of breasts\n- swelling of the clitoris\n- a deepened voice\n- an increased sex drive\n- problems withperiods\n- hair loss\n- severeacne\nIn addition, both men and women who take anabolic steroids can develop any of the following medical conditions:\n- heart attackorstroke\n- liver or kidney problems or failure\n- high blood pressure (hypertension)\n- blood clots\n- fluid retention\n- high cholesterol\nMisusing anabolic steroids can also cause the following psychological or emotional effects:\n- aggressive behaviour\n- mood swings\n- paranoia\n- manic behaviour\n- hallucinationsand delusions\nAnabolic steroids accelerate bone growth, so if they're misused by adolescents who haven't yet had the growth spurt associated with puberty, the drugs can cause premature ageing of the bones and restricted growth.\nAs anabolic steroids are often injected, there are risks associated with sharing needles.

You should ask your anaesthetist to clarify anything you're unsure about.\nIf you have a general anaesthetic, your anaesthetist will carefully monitor you throughout your operation and make sure you wake up comfortably afterwards. They may also help with any pain relief you might need after the procedure."}, {"Side effects": "Anaesthetics consist of a number of medicines that can cause side effects in some people. Your anaesthetist will tell you about any side effects you may experience after having a specific type of anaesthetic and measures that will be taken to reduce these.\nSome common side effects that can occur after a general anaesthetic or some regional anaesthetics include:\n- feeling or being sick\n- dizziness and feeling faint\n- feeling cold or shivering\n- headaches\n- itchiness\n- bruising and soreness\n- difficulty peeing\n- aches and pains\nThe side effects of anaesthetic usually do not last very long and, if necessary, some of them can be treated.\nTell the healthcare professionals treating you if you experience any of the above side effects, or if you're in pain after your procedure."}, {"Risks and complications": "In recent years, having anaesthesia has become very safe. Advances in equipment, medicine and training mean serious problems are rare.\nHowever, as with any type of surgery or medical procedure, there's a potential risk of complications.\nThe benefits and risks of surgery and anaesthesia will be carefully weighed up and explained to you before you have any operation.\nThe complications of anaesthesia listed below are very rare.\nThis can cause numbness or paralysis (inability to move a part of the body), although this may be a result of the surgery itself.\nIf the damage is slight, you may get better in a few days to a few weeks. Permanent damage to the peripheral nerves, which run between the spinal cord and the rest of the body, occurs in around 1 in 1,000 people having a general anaesthetic.\nAlthough an allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) can be severe, appropriate treatment is on hand to enable the best chance of dealing with this immediately and effectively.\nIt's not clear exactly how often anaesthetics cause anaphylaxis, but the best estimate is that a life-threatening allergic reaction occurs in 1 in 10,000 anaesthetics. More than 95 per cent of these will survive and generally recover well.\nIf you're a healthy patient having non-emergency surgery, death is very rare at around 1 in 100,000 people having general anaesthetic. However, this may increase depending on certain factors.\nYour risk of developing complications will depend on a number of factors, including:\n- your medical history \u2013 for example, whether you have any other serious medical conditions or illnesses\n- personal factors \u2013 for example, whether you smoke or are overweight; if you smoke, stopping several weeks before your operation will reduce your risk of having breathing problems, and losing weight will also help reduce your risk\n- the type of procedure \u2013 for example, whether it's a planned or an emergency procedure, or whether it's a major or minor procedure\n- the type of anaesthetic \u2013 local anaesthesia can have advantages over general anaesthesia in the right circumstances\nBefore your procedure, your anaesthetist will explain if there are any particular risks of developing possible complications.\nIn most cases, the benefits outweigh the risks.

However, most children with Angelman syndrome will be able to communicate using gestures, signs or other systems.\nThe movement of a child with Angelman syndrome will also be affected. They may have difficulty walking because of issues with balance and co-ordination (ataxia). Their arms may tremble or make jerky movements, and their legs may be stiff.\nSeveral distinctive behaviours are associated with Angelman syndrome. These include:\n- frequent laughter and smiling, often with little stimulus\n- being easily excitable, often flapping the hands\n- being restless (hyperactive)\n- having a short attention span\n- trouble sleeping and needing less sleep than other children\n- a particular fascination with water\nBy around 2 years of age, a small head which is flat at the back (microbrachycephaly) may be noticeable in some children with Angelman syndrome. Children with Angelman syndrome may also start to have seizures or fits around this age.\nOther possible features of the syndrome include:\n- tendency to stick the tongue out\n- crossed eyes (strabismus)\n- skin, hair and eyes that are paler than other family members\n- a wide mouth with widely spaced teeth\n- a side-to-side curvature of the spine(scoliosis)\n- walking with arms in the air\nSome young babies with Angelman syndrome may have difficulties feeding because they're unable to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing.

A gene is a single unit of genetic material (DNA) that acts as an instruction for the way an individual is made and develops.\nMost cases of Angelman syndrome are caused by the child not getting a copy of the UBE3A gene from its mother, or the gene not working. This means there's no active copy of the gene in the child's brain.\nIn a small number of cases, Angelman syndrome happens when a child gets 2 copies of the gene from their father, rather than 1 from each parent.\nSometimes the cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown. Most children in these unexplained cases have different conditions involving other genes or chromosomes."}, {"Diagnosing Angelman syndrome": "Angelman syndrome may be suspected if a child's development is delayed and they have the syndrome's distinctive characteristics.\nA blood test is used to confirm the diagnosis. Several genetic tests will be done on the blood sample.

This helps to determine whether there's a chance you might have another child with Angelman syndrome.\nMost children with Angelman syndrome are diagnosed between the ages of 9 months to 6 years, when physical and behavioural symptoms become apparent.\nIf your child is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, you will be able to talk to a genetic doctor about what support they might need."}, {"Managing Angelman syndrome": "Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids:\n- anti-epileptic medicineto control seizures\n- physiotherapymay improve posture, balance and walking ability; it's also important to prevent permanent stiffening of the joints as people with Angelman syndrome get older\n- communication therapy may help them develop non-verbal language skills, such as sign language and using visual aids; using iPad applications and similar tablet devices may also help\n- behavioural therapy may be recommended to help overcome behaviours you find hard to manage, such as hyperactivity and a short attention span\nIn later childhood, the seizures usually improve, although they may return in adulthood. With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less hyperactive and may sleep better.\nMost people with the syndrome will have learning disability and limited speech throughout their life. In adults, some mobility may be lost and joints may stiffen.\nPeople with Angelman syndrome usually have good general health and are often able to improve their communication and acquire new skills.\nWhile there's currently no cure for Angelman syndrome, research into treatments is being done in other countries.

However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.\nCoronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)."}, {"When a coronary angioplasty is used": "Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries.\nIn older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease.\nIf the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. \nWhile angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective.\nCoronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack."}, {"What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty?": "In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they're able to do more than they could before the procedure.\nIf you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future."}, {"How a coronary angioplasty is performed": "A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out.\nA thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video.\nWhen the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed.\nIf a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed.\nA coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours.

The liver can also become scarred over time. \nARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents.\nIf both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a 1 in 4  chance of each child they have developing ARPKD.\nThe way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which usually does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. \nADPKD can be inherited if only 1 parent carries one of the genetic faults responsible for the condition.\nFind out more about the causes of ARPKD"}, {"Treating ARPKD": "There's currently no cure for ARPKD, but various treatments can help manage the wide range of problems it can cause.\nTreatment for ARPKD may include:\n- breathing assistance with a machine that moves air in and out of the lungs (a ventilator) for children with severe breathing difficulties\n- medication to treat high blood pressure\n- procedures to stop any internal bleeding that may occur\n- medications to control problems associated with the loss of kidney function, such as iron supplements foranaemia.\nMore than half of all children who survive the early stages of ARPKD will eventually experience kidney failure by the time they're 15 to 20 years old.\nIf kidney failure does occur, there are 2 main treatment options:\n- dialysis, where a machine is used to replicate many functions of the kidney\n- akidney transplant, where a healthy kidney is removed from a living or recently deceased donor and implanted into someone with kidney failure\nFind out more about how ARPKD is treated"}, {"Outlook": "The outlook for children with ARPKD can vary considerably depending on the severity of the condition.\nIf routine scans pick up kidney problems during pregnancy, the baby will usually have a poorer outlook than a child who's diagnosed at a later stage.\nBut in general, ARPKD is a severe condition and around 1 in 3 babies will die from severe breathing difficulties during the first 4 weeks after birth.\nAbout 8 or 9 out of 10 babies with ARPKD who survive the first month of life will live until they're at least 5 years old.\nIt's difficult to predict exactly how long a child with ARPKD will live because there's very little data showing long-term survival rates. \nBut with advances in treatments and a better understanding of the condition, increasing numbers of children with ARPKD are living well into adulthood."}, {"Information about you": "If you have ARPKD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS). \nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.
