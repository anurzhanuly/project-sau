The injury can also happen gradually during slower movements.\nRecurring injury is common in athletes and sportsmen, as you're more likely to injure your hamstring if you've injured it before.\nRegularly doing stretching and strengthening exercises, and warming up before exercise, may help reduce the risk of injuring your hamstring."}, {"How do I know if I've injured my hamstring?": "Mild hamstring strains (grade 1) will usually cause sudden pain and tenderness at the back of your thigh. It may be painful to move your leg, but the strength of the muscle should not be affected.\nPartial hamstring tears (grade 2) are usually more painful and tender. There may also be some swelling and bruising at the back of your thigh and you may have lost some strength in your leg.\nSevere hamstring tears (grade 3) will usually be very painful, tender, swollen and bruised, making it difficult to walk and stand. There may have been a \"popping\" sensation at the time of the injury and you'll be unable to use the affected leg."}, {"When to see a GP": "Most hamstring injuries can be cared for at home.\nSee a GP if you have any concerns about your injury, particularly if you think it's a severe injury, it's not healing, or your symptoms are getting worse.\nThe GP can also advise you about when you can return to your normal activities and what exercises you should do to aid your recovery in the meantime. They may also refer you for a scan or to a physiotherapist for specialist treatment in some cases."}, {"Rest and recovery from a hamstring injury": "Recovering from a hamstring injury may take days, weeks or months, depending on how severe it is.\nA completely torn hamstring may take several months to heal and you'll be unable to resume training or play sport during this time.\nDuring the first 2 or 3 days, you should care for your injury using RICE therapy:\n- Rest\u2013 rest your leg as much as possible.\n- Ice\u2013 apply cold packs (a bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel will also work) to your hamstring for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours during the day. Do not apply ice directly to your skin.\n- Compression\u2013 compress or bandage the thigh to limit any swelling and movement that could cause further damage. You can use a simple elastic bandage or elasticated tubular bandage available from a pharmacy.\n- Elevation\u2013 keep your leg raised and supported on a pillow as much as possible, to help reduce any swelling.\nRegular painkillers, such as paracetamol or a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) cream or gel, may also help relieve the pain.\nShort-term use of oral NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen tablets, can also help reduce swelling and inflammation. However, these are not suitable for everyone. Check the leaflet that comes with your medicine to see if you can take it.\nThe GP may recommend you wear a knee splint for a brief time. This will help stop your leg moving to help it heal.\nReturning to strenuous exercise too quickly could make your injury worse, but avoiding exercise for too long can cause your hamstring muscles to shrink and scar tissue to form around the tear.\nTo avoid this, you should start doing gentle hamstring stretches after a few days, when the pain has started to subside.\nThis should be followed by a programme of gentle exercise, such as walking and cycling, and hamstring strengthening exercises.\nThe GP can give you further advice and, if necessary, refer you to a physiotherapist for a suitable exercise programme.\nTo avoid injuring yourself again, you should only return to a full level of activity when your hamstring muscles are strong enough. Your physiotherapist or GP will be able to advise you about this.\nMany people need to avoid sports for at least a few weeks, but the length of time you need off will depend on the severity of your injury."}]}, {"condition": "Hand tendon repair", "sections": [{"No header": "If any of the tendons in your hand are damaged, surgery may be needed to repair them and help restore movement in the affected fingers or thumb."}, {"What are tendons?": "Tendons are tough cords of tissue that connect muscles to bones.\nWhen a group of muscles contract (tighten), the attached tendons will pull on certain bones, allowing you to make a wide range of movements.\nThere are 2 groups of tendons in the hand:\n- extensor tendons\u2013 which run from the forearm across the back of your hand to your fingers and thumb, allowing you to straighten your fingers and thumb\n- flexor tendons\u2013 which run from your forearm through your wrist and across the palm of your hand, allowing you to bend your fingers\nSurgery can often be used to repair damage to both these groups of tendons."}, {"When hand tendon\u00a0repair\u00a0is needed": "Hand tendon repair is needed when 1 or more tendons in your hand rupture (break or split) or are cut, leading to the loss of normal hand movements.\nIf your extensor tendons are damaged, you'll be unable to straighten 1 or more fingers.

They're available in a range of colours.\nReceiver in the ear (RITE) hearing aids are similar to BTE hearing aids.\nThe main difference is that with RITE hearing aids, the part of the hearing aid that sits behind the ear is smaller and is connected by a thin wire to a speaker placed inside the opening of the ear.\nRITE hearing aids are less visible than BTE hearing aids and are suitable for most people with hearing loss, but they can be more fiddly to use than BTE hearing aids.\nIn the ear (ITE) hearing aids fill the area just outside the opening of your ear.\nThey cannot be seen from behind, unlike BTE or RITE hearing aids, but they are visible from the side.\nITE hearing aids are suitable for most people with hearing loss, although they can be trickier to use than BTE or RITE hearing aids.\nIn the canal (ITC) hearing aids are similar to ITE aids, but are a bit smaller and just fill the opening of the ear.\nThey're less visible than many other types of hearing aid, but can be trickier to use and are not usually powerful enough for people with severe hearing loss.\nCompletely in the canal (CIC) and invisible in the canal (IIC) hearing aids are the smallest types available.\nThey fit further into the opening of your ear than ITC hearing aids and are barely visible. \nBut these hearing aids are not usually powerful enough for people with severe hearing loss. They're also quite fiddly and some can only be put in and taken out by a hearing aid specialist.\nCROS and BiCROS hearing aids can help if you've lost hearing in one ear.\nThey come as a pair. The hearing aid in the ear with hearing loss picks up sound and sends it to a hearing aid in your good ear. This can be done wirelessly or through a wire around the back of your neck.\nBody worn hearing aids are made up of a small box connected to earphones.\nThe box can be clipped to your clothes or put inside a pocket.\nThis type of hearing aid may be best if you have severe hearing loss and need a powerful hearing aid, or if you find the controls on smaller hearing aids tricky to use."}, {"Hearing aids on the NHS": "Hearing aids are available on the NHS.\nYour GP can refer you to an NHS hearing aid provider if they think you might need a hearing aid.\nThe benefits of getting a hearing aid on the NHS include:\n- hearing aids are provided for free as a long-term loan\n- batteries and repairs are free (there may be a charge if you lose or break your hearing aid and it needs to be replaced)\n- you do not have to pay for any follow-up appointments or aftercare\nBut while several modern hearing aids are available on the NHS, these are usually the BTE or, very occasionally, the RITE type.

Some newer types are held onto the head with magnets instead of a connector through the skin.\nA cochlear implant may be an option if you have severe, permanent hearing loss that is not helped by hearing aids. \nThey work by turning sound into electrical signals and sending them to part of the inner ear called the cochlea. From here, the signals travel to the brain and are heard as sound.\nThe implant has 2 main parts:\n- a microphone behind the ear that picks up sound and changes it into electrical signals, which are sent along a wire to a device on the skin\n- a device placed inside the skull that picks up the electrical signals from the device on the skin and sends them along wires to the cochlea\nBefore having a cochlear implant, you'll have an assessment to find out if it will help.

These are usually undertaken at an audiology department.\nSome of the main tests that may be carried out are described on this page.\nVisual reinforcement audiometry (VRA) is usually used to test hearing in children from approximately 6 months of age up to 2.5 years old.\nDuring the test, your child will sit on your lap or a chair while sounds are presented. Your baby will be taught to link the sound to a visual reward such as a toy or computer screen lighting up.\nOnce your child is able to associate the sound and the visual reward the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear.\nYoung children between 1.5 and 5 years old may have a play audiometry test.\nDuring the test, sounds will be played through headphones or speakers and your child will be asked to perform a simple task when they hear the sound. This may vary from putting a ball in a bucket to completing a puzzle.\nAs with VRA, the volume and pitch of the sound will be varied to determine the quietest sounds your child is able to hear.\nOlder children may have a test called pure tone audiometry. This is the test often used to screen a child's hearing before they start school, when it is sometimes referred to as the \"sweep test\". It's similar to a hearing test an adult might have.\nDuring pure tone audiometry, a machine generates sounds at different volumes and frequencies. The sounds are played through headphones and your child is asked to respond when they hear them by pressing a button.\nBy changing the level of the sound, the tester can work out the quietest sounds your child can hear.\nIn addition to using speakers or headphones, most of the tests above can also be carried out using a small vibrating device placed behind the ear.\nThis device passes sound directly to the inner ear through the bones in the head, which can help identify which part of the ear is not working properly if your child is having hearing problems.\nTympanometry is a test to assess how flexible the eardrum is.\nFor good hearing, your eardrum needs to be flexible to allow sound to pass through it. If the eardrum is too rigid \u2013 for example, because there is fluid behind it (glue ear) \u2013 sounds will bounce back off the eardrum instead of passing through it.\nDuring the test, a soft rubber tube will be placed at the entrance of your child's ear. Air is gently blown down the tube and a sound is played through a small speaker inside it. The tube then measures the sound that's bounced back from the ear."}, {"Causes\u00a0of hearing problems in babies and children": "There are a number of reasons why a child may have a hearing problem, including temporary hearing loss from a common illness such as a common cold.\nSome possible causes of hearing loss that may be detected during routine tests include:\n- glue ear\u2013 a build-up of fluid in the middle ear, which is common in young children\n- infections that develop in the womb or at birth, such asrubella (german measles)orcytomegalovirus, which can cause progressive hearing loss\n- inherited conditions which stop the ears or nerves from working properly\n- damage to the cochlear or auditory nerves (which transmit hearing signals to the brain); this could be caused by asevere head injury, exposure to loud noise or head surgery, for example\n- being starved of oxygen at birth (birth asphyxia)\n- illnesses such asmeningitisandencephalitis(which both involve swelling in the brain)"}, {"Spotting\u00a0signs of a hearing problem": "Although your child will be offered routine hearing tests as they grow up, it's still important for you to look out for signs of any problems and seek advice if you have any concerns.\nFor babies, the checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) can be used to help you check your child's hearing as they grow up.\nIn older children, signs of a possible hearing problem can include:\n- inattentiveness or poor concentration\n- not responding when their name is called\n- talking loudly and listening to the television at a high volume\n- difficulty pinpointing where a sound is coming from\n- mispronouncing words\n- a change in their progress at school\nSpeak to a GP or health visitor if you're concerned about your child's hearing.

However, in hidradenitis suppurativa, a secondary bacterial infection is not that common, so a swab of the affected area should be taken.\nIf bacterial infection is not present, low doses of antibiotics may be used to prevent inflammation. This longer course of antibiotics will last at least 3 months, to reduce the number of lumps that develop.\nYou may be given antibiotics as a cream (topical) or as a tablet, capsule or liquid. Antibiotic types can include erythromycin, lymecycline, doxycycline and tetracycline.\nIn severe cases of hidradenitis suppurativa, a combination of clindamycin and rifampicin can be effective, but these antibiotics are usually prescribed by dermatologists rather than GPs.\nAntiseptic washes, such as 4% chlorhexidine, applied daily to affected areas are often prescribed alongside other treatments.\nRetinoids, such as isotretinoin and acitretin, are vitamin-A based medicines.

Steroids can be taken as tablets, or you may have an injection directly into affected skin.\nPossible side effects of steroids include weight gain, poor sleep and mood swings.\nRead more about the side effects of steroid tablets and steroid injections.\nSurgery may be considered in cases where hidradenitis suppurativa cannot be controlled with medicine."}, {"Lifestyle advice": "If you have hidradenitis suppurativa you should:\n- lose weight if you are overweight\n- stop smoking if you smoke\n- use an antiseptic skin wash or antiseptic soap \u2013 this may be prescribed alongside other treatment\n- hold a warm flannel on the lumps to encourage the pus to drain\n- wear loose-fitting clothes\n- avoid shaving affected skin and avoid wearing perfume or perfumed deodorants in the affected areas"}, {"Outlook": "Although hidradenitis suppurativa can persist for many years, if it's diagnosed early the symptoms can be improved with treatment.\nHowever, the condition can have a significant impact on a person's everyday life.

This procedure is called a colostomy formation.\nStools will pass directly out of the opening into a pouch worn on your child's body until they're well enough to have another procedure to remove the affected section of bowel, close the opening and join the healthy sections of bowel together. \nThese procedures can be done using either:\n- laparoscopic (keyhole) surgery\u2013 this involves inserting surgical instruments through tiny cuts\n- open surgery \u2013 where a larger cut is made in your child's tummy\nSpeak to your surgeon about the best option for your child.\nNo surgery is risk-free. There's a small chance of:\n- bleeding during or after the operation\n- the bowel becoming infected (enterocolitis)\n- bowel contents leaking into the body, which could lead to serious infection(peritonitis)if not treated quickly\n- the bowel becoming narrowed or blocked again, requiring further surgery\nYour child will probably need to stay in hospital for a few days after surgery. \nThey'll be given pain-relieving medicine to make them comfortable and fluids into a vein until they can manage food and drink.\nNo special diet is needed once you get home, but it's important they drink plenty of fluids as they recover. \nYour child should recover well and their bowels should function normally after surgery.\nAt first they'll probably have a sore bottom when they poo.

The therapist will help the person to understand what makes it difficult to throw things away and the reasons why the clutter has built up.\nThis will be combined with practical tasks and a plan to work on. It's important the person takes responsibility for clearing the clutter from their home. The therapist will support and encourage this.\nAntidepressant medicines called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have also been shown to help some people with hoarding disorders.\nCBT is a type of therapy that aims to help you manage your problems by changing how you think (cognitive) and act (behaviour).\nIt encourages you to talk about how you think about yourself, the world and other people, and how what you do affects your thoughts and feelings.\nRegular sessions of CBT over a long period of time are usually necessary and will almost always need to include some home-based sessions, working directly on the clutter.\nThis requires motivation, commitment and patience, as it can take many months to achieve the treatment goal.\nThe goal is to improve the person's decision-making and organisational skills, help them overcome urges to save and, ultimately, clear the clutter, room by room. \nThe therapist won't throw anything away but will help guide and encourage the person to do so. The therapist can also help the person develop decision-making strategies, while identifying and challenging underlying beliefs that contribute to the hoarding problem.\nThe person gradually becomes better at throwing things away, learning that nothing terrible happens when they do and becomes better at organising items they insist on keeping.\nAt the end of treatment, the person may not have cleared all their clutter, but they will have gained a better understanding of their problem.

This was backed by a High Court judgement in 2018."}, {"What is homeopathy?": "Homeopathy is a complementary or alternative medicine. This means that homeopathy is different from treatments that are part of conventional Western medicine in important ways.\nIt's based on a series of ideas developed in the 1790s by a German doctor called Samuel Hahnemann.\nA central principle of the \"treatment\" is that \"like cures like\" \u2013 that a substance that causes certain symptoms can also help to remove those symptoms.\nA second central principle is based around a process of dilution and shaking called succussion.\nPractitioners believe that the more a substance is diluted in this way, the greater its power to treat symptoms.\nMany homeopathic remedies consist of substances that have been diluted many times in water until there's none, or almost none, of the original substance left.\nHomeopathy is used to \"treat\" an extremely wide range of conditions, including physical conditions such as asthma and psychological conditions such as depression."}, {"Does homeopathy work?": "There's been extensive investigation of the effectiveness of homeopathy.

Many practitioners believe it can help with any condition.\nAmong the most common conditions that people seek homeopathic treatment for are:\n- asthma\n- ear infections\n- hay fever\n- mental health conditions, such as depression, stress and anxiety\n- allergies, such as food allergies\n- dermatitis (an allergic skin condition)\n- arthritis\n- high blood pressure\nThere's no good-quality evidence that homeopathy is an effective treatment for these or any other health conditions.\nSome practitioners also claim homeopathy can prevent malaria or other diseases. There's no evidence to support this, and no scientifically plausible way that homeopathy can prevent diseases.\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), which advises the NHS on the use of treatments, doesn't recommend using homeopathy in the treatment of any health condition."}, {"What are the regulation issues?": "There's no legal regulation of homeopathic practitioners in the UK.

In cases like these, homeopathic remedies consist of nothing but water.\nSome homeopaths believe that, as a result of the succussion process, the original substance leaves an \"imprint\" of itself on the water. But there's no known mechanism by which this can occur.\nThe 2010 report said: \"We consider the notion that ultra-dilutions can maintain an imprint of substances previously dissolved in them to be scientifically implausible.\"\nSome people who use homeopathy may see an improvement in their health condition as the result of a phenomenon known as the placebo effect.\nIf you choose health treatments that provide only a placebo effect, you may miss out on other treatments that have been proven to be more effective."}]}, {"condition": "Homocystinuria", "sections": [{"No header": "Homocystinuria (HCU) is a rare but potentially serious inherited condition.\nIt means the body can't process the amino acid methionine.

If this works, your child will need to take vitamin B6 supplements for the rest of their life.\nChildren diagnosed with HCU that doesn't respond to vitamin B6 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of methionine your baby receives.\nHigh-protein foods need to be limited, including:\n- meat\n- fish\n- cheese\n- eggs\n- pulses\n- nuts\nYour dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development.\nBreastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Special formula milk may be used.

Some of these may be available on prescription, including low-protein rusks, milk substitutes and low-protein pasta.\nPeople with HCU may need to follow a modified diet for the rest of their life. As your child gets older, they'll eventually need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.\nRegular blood tests will also be needed to monitor the amount of homocysteine in their blood.\nAlongside a low-protein diet, your child may be prescribed a medication called betaine to help clear some of the excess homocysteine.\nMedication for HCU needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor."}, {"How\u00a0homocystinuria is inherited": "The genetic cause (mutation) responsible for HCU is passed on by parents, who usually don't have any symptoms of the condition.\nThe way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive two copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 one from their mother and one from their father. If the baby only receives one affected gene, they'll just be a carrier of HCU.\nIf you're a carrier of the altered gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:\n- a 1 in 4 chance of developing the condition\n- a 2 in 4 chance of being a carrier of HCU\n- a 1 in 4 chance of receiving a pair of normal genes\nAlthough it's not possible to prevent HCU, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition.\nAny further children you have can be tested for the condition as soon as possible and given appropriate treatment.\nYou may also wish to consider genetic counselling for information and advice about genetic conditions."}, {"Information about your child": "If your child has HCU, your clinical team will pass information about them on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Diseases Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThis helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat this condition.
