Then, using your mouthguard at home, you regularly apply the gel for a specified period of time over a few weeks. Some whitening gels can be left on for up to 8 hours at a time, which can shorten the treatment period.\nLaser whitening, also known as power whitening, is another type of teeth whitening system that a dentist can provide.

Symptoms usually first start between the ages of 30 to 50 and the condition sometimes runs in families.\nHashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis cannot be cured, but the symptoms can be treated with a medicine called levothyroxine. Levothyroxine is taken to replace the missing thyroid hormone. If you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis you may need to take levothyroxine for the rest of your life.\nSurgery is only rarely needed \u2013 for instance, if your goitre is particularly uncomfortable or cancer is suspected.\nRead about treating an underactive thyroid gland and treating goitre."}, {"De Quervain's (subacute) thyroiditis": "De Quervain's (subacute) thyroiditis is a painful swelling of the thyroid gland thought to be triggered by a viral infection, such as mumps or flu.\nIt's most commonly seen in women aged 20 to 50.\nIt usually causes high temperature and pain in the neck, jaw or ear. The thyroid gland can also release too much thyroid hormone into the blood (thyrotoxicosis), leading to symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism).\nThese symptoms settle after a few days. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland often follow, lasting weeks or months, before the gland recovers completely.\nPalpitations and shakes associated with thyrotoxicosis can be treated with beta blockers.\nYou can take painkillers, such as ibuprofen, to relieve any pain. If these medicines do not work, steroids (anti-inflammatory medicine) may be prescribed.\nOccasionally, De Quervain's thyroiditis may come back, or the low thyroid hormone levels may be permanent.

This causes a temporary rise in thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis) and symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland.\nThen, after a few weeks, the gland becomes depleted of thyroid hormone. This leads to low thyroid hormone levels and symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland.\nHowever, not every woman with postpartum thyroiditis will go through both these phases.\nIf low thyroid hormone levels are causing severe symptoms medicine may be needed until the condition gets better.\nIf high thyroid hormones are causing symptoms, beta blockers may provide relief.\nIn most women, thyroid function returns to normal within 12 months of the birth, although low thyroid hormone levels can sometimes be permanent."}, {"Silent (painless) thyroiditis": "Silent thyroiditis is very similar to postpartum thyroiditis, but it can affect men and women, and is not related to giving birth.\nLike postpartum thyroiditis, there may be a phase of high thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis) causing symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland. This may be followed by symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland, before the symptoms go away in 12 to 18 months.\nIf low thyroid hormone levels are causing severe symptoms, medicine may be needed until the condition gets better. Occasionally, the low thyroid levels can be permanent."}, {"Drug-induced thyroiditis": "Some medicines can damage the thyroid and cause either symptoms of an overactive thyroid gland or symptoms of an underactive thyroid gland.\nExamples include:\n- interferons (used to treat cancer)\n- lithium(taken for bipolar disorder)\nSymptoms are usually short-lived and may get better after you stop taking the medicine.\nHowever, you should not stop taking any prescribed medicine without discussing it with your doctor.\nDrug-induced thyroiditis can cause pain around the thyroid.

However, the treatments available do help most cases to some degree.\nAn anticonvulsant medicine called carbamazepine, which is often used to treat epilepsy, is the first treatment usually recommended to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine can relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages.\nCarbamazepine needs to be taken several times a day to be effective, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so high enough levels of the medicine can build up in your bloodstream.\nUnless your pain becomes much better, or disappears, the medicine is usually continued for as long as necessary, which could be for many years.\nIf you're entering a period of remission, where your pain goes away, stopping carbamazepine should always be done slowly, over days or weeks, unless a doctor tells you otherwise.\nIf this medicine does not help you, causes too many side effects, or you're unable to take it, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medicines or surgical procedures that may help.\nThere are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia \u2013 usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals \u2013 but these are generally only effective for a few years.\nAlternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open your skull and move any blood vessels that are compressing the trigeminal nerve.

They move the bone when the muscle contracts. In the hand, tendons run along the front and back of the bones in the fingers and are attached to the muscles in the forearm.\nThe tendons on the palm side of the hand (flexor tendons) are held in place by strong bands of tissue, known as ligaments, which are shaped in arches over the tendon. The tendons are covered by a protective sheath which produces a small amount of fluid to keep the tendons lubricated. This allows them to move freely and smoothly within the sheath when the fingers are bent and straightened.\nTrigger finger occurs if there's a problem with the tendon or sheath, such as inflammation and swelling. If the tendon can no longer slide easily through the sheath it can bunch up to form a small lump (nodule). This makes bending the affected finger or thumb difficult. If the tendon gets caught in the sheath, the finger can click painfully as it's straightened.\nThe exact reason why these problems occur is not known, but several factors may increase the likelihood of trigger finger developing. For example, it's more common in women, people over 40 years old, and those with certain medical conditions.\nAnother hand-related condition called Dupuytren's contracture can also increase your risk of developing trigger finger. In Dupuytren's contracture, the connective tissue in the palm of the hand thickens, causing 1 or more fingers to bend into the palm of the hand.\nLong-term conditions, such as diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis, are also associated with trigger finger."}, {"How\u00a0trigger finger is treated": "In some people, trigger finger may get better without treatment.\nHowever, if it is not treated, there's a chance the affected finger or thumb could become permanently bent, which will make performing everyday tasks difficult.\nIf treatment is necessary, several options are available, including:\n- rest\u2013 avoiding certain activities\n- medication\u2013 takingnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)may help relieve pain\n- splinting\u2013 where the affected finger is strapped to a plastic splint to reduce movement\n- steroid injection\u2013 steroids are medicines that can reduce swelling\n- surgery on the affected hand\u2013 surgery can allow the affected tendon to move freely again\nSurgery is usually only used when other treatments have failed.

A course of antibiotics will usually need to be taken for 6 months.\nSeveral different antibiotics are used because some forms of TB are resistant to certain antibiotics. \nIf you're infected with a drug-resistant form of TB, treatment with 6 or more different medications may be needed.\nIf you're diagnosed with pulmonary TB, you'll be contagious for about 2 to 3 weeks into your course of treatment. \nYou will not usually need to be isolated during this time, but it's important to take some basic precautions to stop the infection spreading to your family and friends.\nYou should:\n- stay away from work, school or college until your TB treatment team advises you it's safe to return\n- always cover your mouth when coughing, sneezing or laughing\n- carefully dispose of any used tissues in a sealed plastic bag\n- open windows when possible to ensure a good supply of fresh air in the areas where you spend time\n- avoid sleeping in the same room as other people\nIf you're in close contact with someone who has TB, you may have tests to see whether you're also infected. These can include a chest X-ray, blood tests, and a skin test called the Mantoux test.\nRead more about treating TB"}, {"Vaccination for TB": "The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB, and is recommended on the NHS for babies, children and adults under the age of 35 who are considered to be at risk of catching TB.\nThe BCG vaccine is not routinely given to anyone over the age of 35 as there's no evidence that it works for people in this age group.\nAt-risk groups include: \n- children living in areas with high rates of TB\n- people with close family members from countries with high TB rates\n- people going to live and work with local people for more than 3 months in an area with high rates of TB\nIf you're a healthcare worker or NHS employee and you come into contact with patients or clinical specimens, you should also have a TB vaccination, irrespective of age, if:\n- you have not been previously vaccinated (you do not have a BCG scar or the relevant documentation), and\n- the results of aMantoux skin testor aTB interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) blood testare negative\nRead more about who should have the BCG vaccine"}, {"Countries with high TB rates": "Parts of the world with high rates of TB include:\n- Africa \u2013 particularly sub-Saharan Africa (all the African countries south of the Sahara desert) and west Africa\n- south Asia \u2013 including India, Pakistan, Indonesia and Bangladesh\n- Russia\n- China\n- South America\n- the western Pacific region (to the west of the Pacific Ocean) \u2013 including Vietnam, Cambodia and the Philippines\nGOV.UK has detailed information on each country's TB rates"}]}, {"condition": "Tuberous sclerosis", "sections": [{"No header": "Tuberous sclerosis, also known as tuberous sclerosis complex, is a rare genetic condition that causes mainly non-cancerous (benign) tumours to develop in different parts of the body.\nThe tumours most often affect the brain, skin, kidneys, heart, eyes and lungs.\nTuberous sclerosis is present from birth, although it may not cause obvious problems immediately."}, {"What problems can\u00a0tuberous sclerosis\u00a0cause?": "The tumours caused by tuberous sclerosis can result in a range of associated health problems, including:\n- epilepsy\u2013 a condition that causes seizures (fits)\n- learning disabilities\n- hyperactivity\n- anautistic spectrum disorder\n- skin abnormalities \u2013 such as patches of light-coloured or thickened skin, or red acne-like spots on the face\n- the kidneys not working properly\n- breathing difficulties\n- abuild-up of fluid on the brain (hydrocephalus)\nThese problems can range from mild to severe, and it's possible to have only a few of these problems or a wide range.
