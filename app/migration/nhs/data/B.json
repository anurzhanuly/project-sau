It can also look like a red, scaly patch.\nThere's sometimes some brown or black pigment within the patch.\nThe lump slowly gets bigger and may become crusty, bleed or develop into a painless ulcer.\nBasal cell carcinoma does not usually spread to other parts of the body. There's a small risk (up to 5%) of squamous cell carcinoma spreading to other parts of the body, usually the lymph nodes (small glands found throughout your body).\nSquamous cell carcinoma (SCC) appears as a firm pink lump with a rough or crusted surface. There can be a lot of surface scale and sometimes even a spiky horn sticking up from the surface.\nThe lump often feels tender when touched, bleeds easily and may develop into an ulcer.\nFor both SCC and BCC there can sometimes be considerable skin damage if the tumour is not treated.\nBowen's disease is a precancerous form of Squamous cell carcinoma SCC sometimes referred to as squamous cell carcinoma in situ. It develops slowly and is easily treated. \nThe main sign is a red, scaly patch on the skin that may itch. It most commonly affects elderly women and is often found on the lower leg. However, it can appear on any area of skin.\nAlthough not classed as non-melanoma skin cancer, Bowen's disease can sometimes develop into SCC if left untreated.\nActinic keratoses, also known as solar keratoses, are dry, scaly patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure.\nThe patches can be pink, red or brown, and can vary in size from a few millimetres to a few centimetres across.\nThe affected skin can sometimes become very thick, and occasionally the patches can look like small horns or spikes.\nLike Bowen's disease, actinic keratosis is not classed as non-melanoma skin cancer, but there's a small risk that the patches could develop into squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) if untreated."}, {"What causes non-melanoma skin cancer?": "Overexposure to ultraviolet (UV) light is the main cause of non-melanoma skin cancer.

Their skin may be numbed with a special spray or cream before the sample is taken.\nA tight band (tourniquet) is usually put around your upper arm. This squeezes the arm, temporarily slowing down the flow of blood and causing the vein to swell. This makes it easier for a sample to be taken.\nBefore taking the sample, the doctor or nurse may clean the area of skin with an antiseptic wipe.\nA needle attached to a syringe or special container is inserted into the vein. The syringe is used to draw out a sample of your blood. You may feel a slight pricking or scratching sensation as the needle goes in, but it shouldn't be painful. If you don't like needles and blood, tell the person who is taking the sample so they can make you more comfortable.\nWhen the sample has been taken, the tourniquet will be released, and the needle will be removed. Pressure is applied to the skin for a few minutes using a cotton-wool pad. A plaster may be put on the small wound to keep it clean."}, {"After the test": "Only a small amount of blood is taken during the test so you shouldn't feel any significant after-effects.\nHowever, some people feel dizzy and faint during and after the test. If this has happened to you in the past, tell the person carrying out the test so they're aware and can help you feel more comfortable.\nAfter the test, you may have a small bruise where the needle went in. Bruises can be painful, but are usually harmless and fade over the next few days."}, {"Blood test results": "After the blood sample has been taken, it will be put into a bottle and labelled with your name and details. It will then be sent to a laboratory where it will be examined under a microscope or tested with chemicals, depending on what's being checked.\nThe results are sent back to the hospital or to your GP. Some test results will be ready the same day or a few days later, although others may not be available for a few weeks. You'll be told when your results will be ready and how you'll be given them.\nSometimes, receiving results can be stressful and upsetting.

If it is, you'll be given extra treatment with medicines to suppress your immune system (immunosuppressants).\nOnce you've started to recover, you'll usually be transferred to a specialist transplant ward where you'll continue to be given painkillers, immunosuppressant medicine and nutrition through a tube into a vein (TPN).\nOver time, the majority of people are able to move on from TPN to eating a normal diet fed through the mouth."}, {"Recovery at home": "On average, people who have a small bowel transplant are discharged from hospital after around 4 to 6 weeks.\nIf you live a long distance from the hospital, you may need to stay in accommodation provided by the hospital nearby, for 1 to 2 months after you are discharged, so you can be monitored and treated quickly if any problems develop.\nYou'll be given immunosuppressant medicine to help prevent your body rejecting the transplant.

When a new organ is transplanted, your body's immune system sees it as a threat and makes antibodies, which can stop the organ working properly.\nImmunosuppressant medicines that weaken your immune system are given during and after your transplant and must be taken for life to reduce the risk of your body rejecting the donor bowel.\nAs well as stopping the donated organ working properly, rejection can sometimes mean that bacteria found in the small bowel can get into your bloodstream and cause a serious widespread infection. \nYou'll be closely monitored by the transplant team after surgery to reduce this risk.\nThere's another rare type of rejection where the immune cells transplanted with the new organ fight against the cells of the host. \nThis is called graft versus host disease (GvHD).

glycopyrronium\n- theophylline\nBeta-2 agonists and anticholinergics are available in both short-acting and long-acting forms, whereas theophylline is only available in a long-acting form.\nBeta-2 agonists are used for both asthma and COPD, although some types are only available for COPD. \nThey're usually inhaled using a small handheld inhaler, but may also be available as tablets or syrup. \nFor sudden, severe symptoms, they can also be injected or nebulised. \nA nebuliser is a compressor that turns liquid medication into a fine mist, allowing a large dose of the medicine to be inhaled through a mouthpiece or face mask.\nBeta-2 agonists work by stimulating receptors called beta-2 receptors in the muscles that line the airways, which causes them to relax and allows the airways to widen (dilate).\nThey should be used with caution in people with: \n- an overactive thyroid(hyperthyroidism)\u2013 a condition that occurs when there's too much thyroid hormone in the body\n- cardiovascular disease\u2013 conditions that affect the heart or blood vessels\n- an irregular heartbeat(arrhythmia)\n- high blood pressure(hypertension)\n- diabetes\u2013 a lifelong condition that causes a person's blood sugar level to become too high\nIn rare cases, beta-2 agonists can make some of the symptoms and possible complications of these conditions worse.\nAnticholinergics (also known as antimuscarinics) are mainly used to treat COPD, but a few can also be used for asthma. \nThey're usually taken using an inhaler, but may be nebulised to treat sudden and severe symptoms.\nAnticholinergics cause the airways to widen by blocking the cholinergic nerves. \nThese nerves release chemicals that can cause the muscles lining the airways to tighten.\nThey should be used with caution in people with:\n- benign prostate enlargement\u2013 where the prostate gland becomes enlarged, which can affect how you pee\n- a bladder outflow obstruction \u2013 any condition that affects the flow of urine out of the bladder, such as bladder stones orprostate cancer\n- glaucoma\u2013 a build-up of pressure in the eye\nIf you have benign prostate enlargement or a bladder outflow obstruction, anticholinergics can cause problems, such as difficulty peeing and not being able to empty your bladder fully.\nGlaucoma can get worse if anticholinergic medication unintentionally gets into the eyes.\nTheophylline is usually taken in tablet or capsule form, but a different version called aminophylline can be given directly into a vein (intravenously) if your symptoms are severe.\nIt's unclear exactly how theophylline works, but it seems to reduce any inflammation (swelling) in the airways, in addition to relaxing the muscles lining them.\nThe effect of theophylline is weaker than other bronchodilators and corticosteroids. \nIt's also more likely to cause side effects, so is often only used alongside these medicines if they're not effective enough.\nTheophylline should be used with caution in people with:\n- an overactive thyroid\n- cardiovascular disease\n- liver problems, such asliver disease\n- high blood pressure\n- open sores that develop on the stomach lining(stomach ulcers)\n- a condition that affects the brain and causes repeated fits (seizures)(epilepsy)\nTheophylline may make these conditions worse. In people with liver problems, it can sometimes lead to a dangerous build-up of medication in the body.\nOther medicines can also cause an abnormal build-up of theophylline in the body. This should always be checked by your doctor.\nElderly people may also need additional monitoring while taking theophylline."}, {"Side effects": "The side effects of bronchodilators can vary, depending on the specific medication you're taking. \nMake sure you read the leaflet that comes with your medication to see what the specific side effects are.\nGeneral side effects of bronchodilators include:\n- trembling, particularly in the hands\n- headaches\n- adry mouth\n- suddenly noticeable heartbeats(palpitations)\n- muscle cramps\n- acough\n- nausea and vomiting\n- diarrhoea\nFind out more about the side effects of bronchodilators"}, {"Pregnancy and breastfeeding": "In most cases bronchodilators should be taken as normal while pregnant or breastfeeding.\nBut speak to your GP if you regularly use bronchodilators and you're considering having a baby or think you might be pregnant.\nPregnancy may affect your asthma, so it's important to continue taking your medication and have it monitored regularly to make sure the condition is controlled.\nFind out more about taking medication during pregnancy"}, {"Interactions with other medicines": "Bronchodilators may interact with other medicines, which could affect the way they work or increase your risk of side effects.\nSome of the medicines that can interact with bronchodilators (particularly theophylline) include:\n- some diuretics, a type of medication that helps remove fluid from the body\n- someantidepressants, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs)\n- digoxin, a medication used to treatarrhythmias\n- benzodiazepines, a type of sedative that may sometimes be used as a short-term treatment foranxietyor sleeping problems(insomnia)\n- lithium, a medication used to treat severedepressionandbipolar disorder\n- quinolones, a type ofantibiotic medication\nThis is not a complete list of all the medications that can interact with bronchodilators, and not all of these interactions apply to each type of bronchodilator.\nAlways carefully read the patient information leaflet that comes with your medication. \nYou may be able to find a specific leaflet on the medicines A to Z on the MHRA website. \nIf in doubt, speak to a pharmacist or GP."}]}, {"condition": "Brucellosis", "sections": [{"No header": "Brucellosis is an infection you can catch from unpasteurised milk and cheese.
