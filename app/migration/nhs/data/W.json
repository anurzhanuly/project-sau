You'll feel some pressure just before the tooth is removed, as your dentist or oral surgeon needs to widen the tooth socket by rocking the tooth back and forth.\nA small cut in the gum is sometimes necessary, and the tooth may need to be cut into smaller pieces before it's removed.\nIt takes anything from a few minutes to 20 minutes, or sometimes even longer, to remove a wisdom tooth. \nAfter your wisdom teeth have been removed, you may have swelling and discomfort, both inside and outside your mouth.

Dry socket is more likely if you don't follow the after-care instructions given by your dentist.\nThere's also a small risk of nerve damage, which can cause a tingling or numb sensation in your tongue, lower lip, chin, teeth and gums.

Many cases are diagnosed in otherwise healthy young adults.\nSometimes the extra electrical connection won't cause any symptoms and may only be picked up when an electrocardiogram (ECG) test is carried out for another reason.

With treatment, the condition can normally be completely cured. For some people, their condition settles down without needing treatment.\nWPW syndrome can sometimes be life-threatening, particularly if it occurs alongside a type of irregular heartbeat called atrial fibrillation. But this is rare and treatment can eliminate this risk."}, {"Symptoms of WPW syndrome": "If you have WPW syndrome, you may experience episodes where your heart suddenly starts racing, before stopping or slowing down abruptly.

They then relax, allowing the heart to fill with blood again. This is controlled by electrical signals.\nIn WPW syndrome, there's an extra electrical connection in the heart, which allows electrical signals to bypass the usual route and form a short circuit. This means the signals travel round and round in a loop, causing episodes where the heart beats very fast.\nThe extra electrical connection is caused by a strand of heart muscle that grows while the unborn baby is developing in the womb.\nIt's not clear exactly why this happens. It just seems to occur randomly in some babies, although rare cases have been found to run in families."}, {"Diagnosing WPW syndrome": "If your doctor thinks you might have WPW syndrome after assessing your symptoms, they'll probably recommend having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and will refer you to a heart specialist (cardiologist).\nAn ECG is a test that records your heart's rhythm and electrical activity. Small discs called electrodes are stuck onto your arms, legs and chest and connected by wires to an ECG machine. The machine records the tiny electrical signals produced by your heart each time it beats.\nIf you have WPW syndrome, the ECG will record an unusual pattern that isn't usually present in people who don't have the condition.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, you may be asked to wear a small portable ECG recorder so your heart rhythm can be recorded during an episode. The recorder will trace your heart rate continuously over a few days, or when you switch it on at the start of an episode."}, {"Treatments for WPW syndrome": "In many cases, episodes of abnormal heart activity associated with WPW syndrome are harmless, don't last long, and settle down on their own without treatment.\nYou may therefore not need any treatment if your symptoms are mild or occur very occasionally, although you should still have regular check-ups so your heart can be monitored.\nIf your cardiologist recommends treatment, there are a number of options available. You can have treatment to either stop episodes when they occur, or prevent them occurring in the future.\nThere are 3 main techniques and treatments that can help stop episodes as they occur. These are:\n- Vagal manoeuvres\u2013 techniques designed to stimulate the nerve that slows down the electrical signals in your heart. An example is the \"Valsalva manoeuvre\", where you hold your nose, close your mouth and exhale hard while straining as if you're on the toilet.\n- Medication\u2013 an injection of medicine such as adenosine can be given in hospital if vagal manoeuvres don't help. It can block the abnormal electrical signals in your heart.\n- Cardioversion\u2013 a type of electric shock therapy that jolts the heart back into a normal rhythm. This may be carried out in hospital if the above treatments don't work.\nTechniques and treatments that can help prevent episodes include:\n- Lifestyle changes\u2013 if your episodes are triggered by things such as strenuous exercise or alcohol, avoiding these may help. Your cardiologist can advise you about this.\n- Catheter ablation\u2013 this procedure is commonly used nowadays to destroy the extra part of the heart causing the problems in the heart's electrical system.
