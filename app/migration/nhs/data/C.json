[{"condition": "CABG, see Coronary artery bypass graft", "sections": [{"No header": "A coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) is a surgical procedure used to treat coronary heart disease.\nIt diverts blood around narrowed or clogged parts of the major arteries to improve blood flow and oxygen supply to the heart."}, {"Why it's carried out": "Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood.\nThis is supplied by 2 large blood vessels called the left and right coronary arteries.\nOver time, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened by the build-up of fatty deposits called plaques.\nThis process is known as atherosclerosis.\nPeople with atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries are said to have coronary heart disease.\nYour chances of developing coronary heart disease increase with age.\nYou're also much more likely to be affected if:\n- you smoke\n- you're overweight orobese\n- you have a high-fat diet\nCoronary heart disease can cause angina, which is chest pain that happens when the supply of oxygen-rich blood to the heart becomes restricted.\nWhile angina can often be treated with medicine, severe angina may require a coronary artery bypass graft to improve the blood supply to the heart.\nAnother risk associated with coronary heart disease is the possibility of one of the plaques in the coronary artery rupturing (splitting), creating a blood clot.\nIf the blood clot blocks the blood supply to the heart, it can trigger a heart attack.\nA coronary artery bypass graft may be recommended to reduce your chances of having a heart attack."}, {"The procedure": "A coronary artery bypass graft involves taking a blood vessel from another part of the body (usually the chest, leg or arm) and attaching it to the coronary artery above and below the narrowed area or blockage.\nThis new blood vessel is known as a graft. The number of grafts needed will depend on how severe your coronary heart disease is and how many of the coronary blood vessels are narrowed.\nA coronary artery bypass graft is carried out under general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious during the operation. It usually takes between 3 and 6 hours."}, {"Recovery": "Most people will need to stay in hospital for about 6 to 8 days after having a coronary artery bypass graft.\nYou should have a follow-up appointment, typically about 6 to 8 weeks after your operation.\nRecovering takes time and everyone recovers at slightly different speeds.\nGenerally, you should be able to sit in a chair after 1 day, walk after 3 days, and walk up and down stairs after 5 or 6 days.\nWhen you go home, you'll need to take things easy for a few weeks.\nYou should be able to return to most of your normal activities after about 6 weeks, including working, driving and having sex. If you have a heavy manual job, you may need to stay off work longer.\nMost people make a full recovery within 12 weeks."}, {"Risks of surgery": "As with all types of surgery, a coronary artery bypass graft carries a risk of complications.\nThese are usually relatively minor and treatable, such as an irregular heartbeat or a wound infection, but there's also a risk of serious complications, such as a stroke or heart attack."}, {"After surgery": "After having a coronary artery bypass graft, most people will experience a significant improvement in symptoms such as breathlessness and chest pain, and their heart attack risk will be lowered.\nBut a coronary artery bypass graft isn't a cure for coronary heart disease.\nIf you don't make lifestyle changes, such as eating a healthy diet and exercising regularly, your grafted arteries will also eventually become hardened and narrowed.\nSometimes, a coronary artery bypass graft may need to be repeated or you may need a procedure to widen your arteries using a small balloon and a tube called a stent (coronary angioplasty)."}, {"Alternatives": "A coronary angioplasty is the main alternative to a coronary artery bypass graft.\nIt's a less invasive operation where a long, flexible, hollow plastic tube called a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in your arm or groin.\nThe tip of the catheter is guided under X-ray to the arteries that supply your heart, to the point where the narrowing of the artery has occurred.\nA balloon attached to the catheter is then inflated to widen the artery and a small metal tube called a stent is often used to help keep the artery open.\nIt usually takes less time to recover from a coronary angioplasty than from a coronary artery bypass graft, but there's a higher chance that the procedure will need to be repeated.\nAlso, a coronary angioplasty may not be recommended if multiple coronary arteries have become blocked and narrowed or the structure of the blood vessels near your heart is abnormal."}, {"How long will I have to wait for surgery?": "The length of time you'll have to wait to have a coronary artery bypass graft will vary from area to area.\nYour GP or cardiac surgeon should be able to tell you what the waiting lists are like in your area or at the hospital you have chosen.\nIdeally, you should be treated within 3 months of the decision to operate."}, {"Video: what is a heart bypass": "This animation explains in detail how a coronary artery bypass, a surgical procedure, is performed."}]}, {"condition": "Caesarean section", "sections": [{"No header": "A caesarean section, or C-section, is an operation to deliver your baby through a cut made in your tummy and womb.\nThe cut is usually made across your tummy, just below your bikini line.\nA caesarean is a major operation that carries a number of risks, so it's usually only done if it's the safest option for you and your baby.\nAround 1 in 4 pregnant women in the UK has a caesarean birth."}, {"Why\u00a0caesareans are\u00a0carried out": "A caesarean may be recommended as a planned (elective) procedure or done in an emergency if it's thought a vaginal birth is too risky.\nPlanned caesareans are usually done from the 39th week of pregnancy.\nA caesarean may be carried out because:\n- your baby is in thebreech position(feet first) and your doctor or midwife has been unable to turn them by applying gentle pressure to your tummy, or you'd prefer they did not try this\n- you have alow-lying placenta(placenta praevia)\n- you have pregnancy-related high blood pressure(pre-eclampsia)\n- you have certain infections, such as a firstgenital herpesinfection occurring late in pregnancy or untreatedHIV\n- your baby is not getting enough oxygen and nutrients \u2013 sometimes this may mean the baby needs to be delivered immediately\n- your labour is not progressing or there's excessive vaginal bleeding\nIf there's time to plan the procedure, your midwife or doctor will discuss the benefits and risks of a caesarean compared with a vaginal birth."}, {"Asking\u00a0for a caesarean": "Some women choose to have a caesarean for non-medical reasons.\nIf you ask your midwife or doctor for a caesarean when there are not medical reasons, they'll explain the overall benefits and risks of a caesarean to you and your baby compared with a vaginal birth.\nIf you're anxious about giving birth, you should be offered the chance to discuss your anxiety with a healthcare professional who can offer support during your pregnancy and labour.\nIf after discussing all the risks and hearing about all the support on offer you still feel that a vaginal birth is not an acceptable option, you should be offered a planned caesarean.

This means you'll be admitted to hospital on the same day you have surgery and won't have to stay overnight.\nYou'll be asked not to eat and drink for 6 hours before surgery if you're having a general anaesthetic.\nAfter you have been admitted to hospital, you'll be seen by the members of the medical team carrying out the procedure, including your surgeon and anaesthetist.\nThis is a good opportunity to discuss any concerns you have and ask questions about anything you're not sure about.\nYou'll be asked to sign a consent form to confirm you agree to the surgery.\nYou'll usually either have a general anaesthetic, which means you'll be unconscious throughout the procedure, or a local anaesthetic injection, which will numb your penis and the surrounding area.\nIn some cases, a spinal anaesthetic, where you're unable to feel anything below your waist, will be used.\nRead more about the different types of anaesthesia.\nCircumcision is a relatively simple procedure. The foreskin is removed just behind the head of the penis using a scalpel or surgical scissors.\nAny bleeding can be stopped using heat (cauterisation), and the remaining edges of skin will be stitched together using dissolvable stitches.\nThe British Association of Urological Surgeons (BAUS) has produced a leaflet that outlines the circumcision procedure (PDF, 970kb) in more detail."}, {"Recovering\u00a0after male circumcision": "When you're discharged from hospital, you'll be given advice about your recovery at home, including when you can drive, return to work and have sex.\nIt usually takes at least 10 days for your penis to heal after circumcision.\nYou'll probably be advised to take at least 1 week off work to recover.\nYou don't need to tell the DVLA if you have had a routine circumcision and don't have any other medical conditions that affect your ability to drive.\nBut it's your responsibility to ensure you're fit to drive after having surgery.\nYou should avoid having sex for at least 4 weeks after your operation.\nYour care team will give you a contact number to call in case you experience any problems or have any concerns.\nYou should also be given details about your follow-up appointment, which may be at the hospital or with your GP.\nFor 3 or 4 days after your operation, it's likely you'll experience some discomfort and swelling around the head of your penis.\nBefore leaving hospital, you'll be given painkilling medication, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help ease this.\nBut contact your GP if you have a temperature, increased redness, bleeding, persistent pain or throbbing of your penis, as it could be a sign of infection.\nApplying petroleum jelly (Vaseline) around the tip of your penis will stop it sticking to your underwear.\nWearing light, loose-fitting clothing for 2 or 3 days after your operation will also help avoid irritation to your penis while it heals.\nYou shouldn't feel any pain or discomfort while passing urine, but contact your medical team if you do."}, {"Risks\u00a0of male circumcision": "In the UK, complications after circumcisions carried out for medical reasons are rare and most men don't experience any significant problems.\nApart from the initial swelling, bleeding and infection are the 2 most common problems associated with circumcision.\nThere's between a 1 in 10 and a 1 in 50 chance that you'll experience bleeding or infection.\nOther possible complications of circumcision can include:\n- permanent reduction in sensation in the head of the penis, particularly during sex\n- tenderness around the scar\n- the need to remove stitches that haven't dissolved\n- occasionally, another operation is needed to remove some more skin from around the head of the penis"}]}, {"condition": "Cirrhosis", "sections": [{"No header": "Cirrhosis is scarring (fibrosis) of the liver caused by long-term liver damage.

On average, symptoms develop between the ages of 60 and 65.\nDespite being the most common type of CJD, sporadic CJD is still very rare, affecting only 1 or 2 people in every million each year in the UK.\nIn 2020, there were 131 recorded deaths from sporadic CJD in the UK.\nVariant CJD (vCJD) is likely to be caused by consuming meat from a cow that had bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE, or \"mad cow\" disease), a similar prion disease to CJD.\nSince the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain.\nSee preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information.\nBut the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear.\nThe incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD.\nThe prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion, although this has only happened 5 times in the UK.\nIn 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK.\nFamilial CJD is a very rare genetic condition where one of the genes a person inherits from their parent (the prion protein gene) carries a mutation that causes prions to form in their brain during adulthood, triggering the symptoms of CJD.\nIt affects about 1 in every 9 million people in the UK.\nThe symptoms of familial CJD usually first develop in people when they're in their early 50s.\nIn 2020, there were 6 deaths from familial CJD and similar inherited prion diseases in the UK.\nIatrogenic CJD is where the infection is accidentally spread from someone with CJD through medical or surgical treatment.\nFor example, a common cause of iatrogenic CJD in the past was growth hormone treatment using human pituitary growth hormones extracted from deceased individuals, some of whom were infected with CJD.\nSynthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk.\nIatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.\nBut increased awareness of these risks means iatrogenic CJD is now very rare.\nIn 2020, there was 1 death from iatrogenic CJD in the UK caused by receiving human growth hormone before 1985."}, {"How CJD is treated": "There's currently no cure for CJD, so treatment aims to relieve symptoms and make the affected person feel as comfortable as possible.\nThis can include using medicine such as antidepressants to help with anxiety and depression, and painkillers to relieve pain.\nSome people will need nursing care and assistance with feeding.\nRead more about treating Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease."}, {"Variant CJD compensation scheme": "In October 2001, the government announced a compensation scheme for UK victims of variant CJD.\nThe vCJD Trust assesses claims and pays compensation to victims and their families."}]}, {"condition": "Claustrophobia", "sections": [{"No header": "Claustrophobia is the irrational fear of confined spaces.\nPeople affected by claustrophobia will often go out of their way to avoid confined spaces, such as lifts, tunnels, tube trains and public toilets.

treating some mental health problems, but it may not be successful or suitable for everyone.\nSome of the advantages of CBT include:\n- it may be helpful in cases where medicine alone has not worked\n- it can be completed in a relatively short period of time compared with other talking therapies\n- the highly structured nature of CBT means it can be provided in different formats, including in groups, self-help books and online\n- it teaches you useful and practical strategies that can be used in everyday life, even after the treatment has finished\nSome of the disadvantages of CBT to consider include:\n- you need to commit yourself to the process to get the most from it \u2013 a therapist can help and advise you, but they need your co-operation\n- attending regular CBT sessions and carrying out any extra work between sessions can take up a lot of your time\n- it may not be suitable for people with more complex mental health needs or learning difficulties, as it requires structured sessions\n- it involves confronting your emotions and anxieties \u2013 you may experience initial periods where you're anxious or emotionally uncomfortable\n- it focuses on the person's capacity to change themselves (their thoughts, feelings and behaviours) \u2013 this does not address any wider problems in systems or families that often have a significant impact on someone's health and wellbeing\nSome critics also argue that because CBT only addresses current problems and focuses on specific issues, it does not address the possible underlying causes of mental health conditions,

They're alive but can't be woken up and show no signs of awareness.\nThe person's eyes will be closed and they'll appear to be unresponsive to their environment. They won't normally respond to sound or pain, or be able to communicate or move voluntarily, and basic reflexes, such as coughing and swallowing, will be greatly reduced.\nThey may be able to breathe on their own, although some people require a machine to help them breathe.\nOver time, the person may start to gradually regain consciousness and become more aware. Some people will wake up after a few weeks, while others may go into a vegetative or minimally conscious state. Read more about disorders of consciousness."}, {"Caring for and monitoring a person in a coma": "Doctors assess a person's level of consciousness using a tool called the Glasgow Coma Scale (on Headway's website). This level is monitored constantly for signs of improvement or deterioration. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses 3 things:\n- eye opening \u2013 a score of 1 means no eye opening, and 4 means opens eyes spontaneously\n- verbal response to a command \u2013 a score of 1 means no response, and 5 means alert and replying appropriately\n- voluntary movements in response to a command \u2013 a score of 1 means no response, and 6 means obeys commands\nMost people in a coma will have a total score of 8 or less. A lower score means someone may have experienced more severe brain damage and could be less likely to recover.\nIn the short term, a person in a coma will normally be looked after in an intensive care unit (ICU). Treatment involves ensuring their condition is stable and body functions, such as breathing and blood pressure, are supported while the underlying cause is treated.\nIn the longer term, healthcare staff will give supportive treatment on a hospital ward. This can involve providing nutrition, trying to prevent infections, moving the person regularly so they don't develop bedsores and gently exercising their joints to stop them becoming tight."}, {"What you can do as a visitor": "The experience of being in a coma differs from person to person. Some people feel they can remember events that happened around them while they were in a coma, while others don't.\nWhen visiting a friend or loved one in a coma, you may find this advice helpful:\n- when you arrive, announce who you are\n- talk to them about your day as you normally would \u2013 be aware that everything you say in front of them might be heard\n- show them your love and support \u2013 even just sitting and holding their hand or stroking their skin can be a great comfort\nResearch has also suggested that stimulating the main senses \u2013 touch, hearing, vision and smell \u2013 could potentially help a person recover from a coma. Focus on pleasant sensations, 1 sensation at a time for short periods of time.\nAs well as talking to the person and holding their hand, you might want to try playing them their favourite music through headphones, putting flowers in their room or spraying a favourite perfume."}, {"Recovering from a coma": "A coma usually only lasts a few weeks, during which time the person may start to gradually wake up and gain consciousness, or progress into a different state of unconsciousness called a vegetative state or minimally conscious state:\n- a vegetative state \u2013 where a person is awake but shows no signs of being aware of their surroundings or themselves\n- a minimally conscious state \u2013 where a person has limited awareness that comes and goes\nSome people may recover from these states gradually, while others may not improve for years, if at all. See the page on disorders of consciousness for more information about these conditions.\nPeople who do wake up from a coma usually come round gradually. They may be very agitated and confused to begin with.\nSome people will make a full recovery and be completely unaffected by the coma. Others will have disabilities caused by the damage to their brain. They may need physiotherapy, occupational therapy and psychological assessment and support during a period of rehabilitation, and may need care for the rest of their lives.\nThe chances of someone recovering from a coma largely depend on the severity and cause of their brain injury, their age and how long they've been in a coma.

However, most modern angioplasty procedures also involve inserting a short wire-mesh tube, called a stent, into the artery during the procedure. The stent is left in place permanently to allow blood to flow more freely.\nCoronary angioplasty is sometimes known as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). The combination of coronary angioplasty with stenting is usually referred to as percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)."}, {"When a coronary angioplasty is used": "Like all organs in the body, the heart needs a constant supply of blood. This is supplied by the coronary arteries.\nIn older people, these arteries can become narrowed and hardened (known as atherosclerosis), which can cause coronary heart disease.\nIf the flow of blood to the heart becomes restricted, it can lead to chest pain known as angina, which is usually triggered by physical activity or stress. \nWhile angina can often be treated with medication, a coronary angioplasty may be required to restore the blood supply to the heart in severe cases where medication is ineffective.\nCoronary angioplasties are also often used as an emergency treatment after a heart attack."}, {"What are the benefits of a coronary angioplasty?": "In most cases, the blood flow through the coronary arteries improves after an angioplasty. Many people find their symptoms get significantly better and they're able to do more than they could before the procedure.\nIf you've had a heart attack, an angioplasty can increase your chances of surviving more than clot-busting medication (thrombolysis). The procedure can also reduce your chances of having another heart attack in the future."}, {"How a coronary angioplasty is performed": "A coronary angioplasty is performed using local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake while the procedure is carried out.\nA thin flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into one of your arteries through an incision in your groin, wrist or arm. This is guided to the affected coronary artery using an X-ray video.\nWhen the catheter is in place, a thin wire is guided down the length of the affected coronary artery, delivering a small balloon to the affected section of artery. This is then inflated to widen the artery, squashing fatty deposits against the artery wall so blood can flow through it more freely when the deflated balloon is removed.\nIf a stent is being used, this will be around the balloon before it's inserted. The stent will expand when the balloon is inflated and remains in place when the balloon is deflated and removed.\nA coronary angioplasty usually takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours. If you're being treated for angina, you'll normally be able to go home later the same day or the day after you have the procedure. You'll need to avoid heavy lifting, strenuous activities and driving for at least a week. \nIf you've been admitted to hospital following a heart attack, you may need to stay in hospital for several days after the angioplasty procedure before going home.\nRead more about: \n- what happens during a coronary angioplasty\n- recovering from a coronary angioplasty"}, {"How safe is a coronary angioplasty?": "A coronary angioplasty is 1 of the most common types of treatment for the heart. \nCoronary angioplasties are most commonly performed in people aged 65 or older, as they're more likely to have heart disease.\nAs the procedure doesn't involve making major incisions in the body, it's usually carried out safely in most people.
