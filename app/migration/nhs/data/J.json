[{"condition": "Japanese encephalitis", "sections": [{"No header": "Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection that's spread through mosquito bites. It's most common in rural areas in southeast Asia, the Pacific islands and the Far East, but is very rare in travellers.\nThe virus is found in pigs and birds, and is passed to mosquitoes when they bite infected animals. It cannot be spread from person to person.\nThere's currently no cure for Japanese encephalitis. Treatment involves supporting the functions of the body as it tries to fight off the infection. \nThe person usually needs to be admitted to hospital so they can be given fluids, oxygen and medication to treat any symptoms."}, {"Symptoms": "Most people infected by the Japanese encephalitis virus have either no symptoms or mild short-lived symptoms, which are often mistaken for flu.\nBut around 1 in every 250 people who become infected with Japanese encephalitis develop more severe symptoms as the infection spreads to the brain. \nThis usually happens 5 to 15 days after infection.\nSymptoms can include:\n- a high temperature (fever)\n- seizures (fits)\n- a stiff neck\n- confusion\n- the inability to speak\n- uncontrollable shaking of body parts(tremor)\n- muscle weakness orparalysis\nUp to 1 in every 3 people who develop these more serious symptoms will die as a result of the infection.\nIn those who survive, these symptoms tend to slowly improve. \nBut it can take several months to make a full recovery, and up to half of those who do survive are left with permanent brain damage. \nThis can lead to long-term problems, such as tremors and muscle twitches, personality changes, muscle weakness, learning difficulties and paralysis in 1 or more limbs."}, {"When to get medical advice": "You should get immediate medical advice if you have any of the symptoms of Japanese encephalitis and you have recently visited, or are still in, an area where the infection is found.\nGOV.UK has information about who to contact when you need immediate medical help abroad. \nIf you're already back in the UK, see your GP.\nYour GP or the healthcare professional treating you will ask about your symptoms, where you have been travelling, what you did on your trip and what vaccinations you have had. \nIf necessary, they may carry out a blood test to see if you have an infection."}, {"How common is Japanese encephalitis?": "It's very rare for travellers visiting risk areas to be affected by Japanese encephalitis. \nIt's estimated less than 1 in a million travellers get Japanese encephalitis in any given year.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) estimates there are around 68,000 cases of Japanese encephalitis worldwide each year.\nThe people most at risk are those who live and work in rural areas, such as on pig farms and in rice fields, where the condition is widespread. \nAround 75% of cases involve children under the age of 15.\nFind out more about the causes of Japanese encephalitis, and which countries have the highest risk."}, {"Preventing Japanese encephalitis": "The best way to prevent Japanese encephalitis is to be vaccinated against the infection before you visit a part of the world where there's a risk of catching it. \nThe risk is greater if you're planning to visit rural areas or go hiking or camping.\nThe vaccine, which is usually only available privately, gives protection against Japanese encephalitis in more than 9 out of 10 people who receive it.\nEven if you have been vaccinated, you should still take precautions to reduce your risk of being bitten by an infected mosquito, such as:\n- sleeping in rooms with close-fitting gauze over the windows and doors \u2013 if you're sleeping outside, use a mosquito net that's been impregnated with insecticide\n- covering up with long-sleeved tops, trousers and socks\n- applying a good-quality insect repellent to exposed areas of skin\nFind out more about how to prevent Japanese encephalitis"}, {"Accessing healthcare abroad": "It's a good idea to keep a list of important telephone numbers with you when travelling abroad. \nThese should include numbers for:\n- local emergency services\n- a representative of the travel company you booked your visit with\n- your travel insurer\n- the British consulate or embassy in the area you're visiting \u2013 GOV.UK has adirectory of British consulates and embassies\nFind out more about accessing healthcare abroad"}]}, {"condition": "Jaundice", "sections": [{"No header": "Jaundice is when your skin or the whites of your eyes turn yellow.

Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, are broken down.\nJaundice is common in newborn babies because babies have a high number of red blood cells in their blood, which are broken down and replaced frequently.\nAlso, a newborn baby's liver is not fully developed, so it's less effective at removing the bilirubin from the blood.\nBy the time a baby is about 2 weeks old, their liver is more effective at processing bilirubin, so jaundice often corrects itself by this age without causing any harm.\nIn a small number of cases, jaundice can be the sign of an underlying health condition. This is often the case if jaundice develops shortly after birth (within the first 24 hours)."}, {"How common is newborn jaundice?": "Jaundice is one of the most common conditions that can affect newborn babies.\nIt's estimated 6 out of every 10 babies develop jaundice, including 8 out of 10 babies born prematurely before the 37th week of pregnancy.\nBut only around 1 in 20 babies has a blood bilirubin level high enough to need treatment.\nFor reasons that are unclear, breastfeeding increases a baby's risk of developing jaundice, which can often persist for a month or longer. \nBut in most cases, the benefits of breastfeeding far outweigh any risks associated with jaundice."}, {"Treating newborn jaundice": "Treatment for newborn jaundice is not usually needed because the symptoms normally pass within 10 to 14 days, although they can occasionally last longer.\nTreatment is usually only recommended if tests show very high levels of bilirubin in a baby's blood.\nThis is because there's a small risk the bilirubin could pass into the brain and cause brain damage.\nThere are 2 main treatments that can be carried out in hospital to quickly reduce your baby's bilirubin levels.\nThese are:\n- phototherapy \u2013 a special type of light shines on the skin, which alters the bilirubin into a form that can be more easily broken down by the liver\n- an exchange transfusion \u2013 where your baby's blood is removed using a thin tube (catheter) placed in their blood vessels and replaced with blood from a matching donor; most babies respond well to treatment and can leave hospital after a few days"}, {"Complications": "If a baby with very high levels of bilirubin is not treated, there's a risk they could develop permanent brain damage.
