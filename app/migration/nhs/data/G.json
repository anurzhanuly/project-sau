Your doctor should discuss the potential risks and benefits with you.\nDomperidone should only be taken at the lowest effective dose for the shortest possible time because of the small risk of potentially serious heart-related side effects.\nIf dietary changes and medicine do not help your symptoms, a relatively new treatment called gastroelectrical stimulation may be recommended. However, this is currently not routinely funded by many NHS authorities.\nGastroelectrical stimulation involves surgically implanting a battery-operated device under the skin of your tummy.\nTwo leads attached to this device are fixed to the muscles of your lower stomach. They send electrical impulses to help stimulate the muscles involved in controlling the passage of food through your stomach. The device is turned on using a handheld external control.\nThe effectiveness of this treatment can vary considerably. Not everyone will respond to it, and for many people who do respond, the effect will largely wear off within 12 months. This means electrical stimulation is not suitable for everyone with gastroparesis.\nThere's also a small chance of this procedure leading to complications that would require removing the device, such as:\n- infection\n- the device dislodging and moving\n- a hole forming in your stomach wall\nSpeak to your surgeon about the possible risks. You can also read the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on gastroelectrical stimulation for gastroparesis.\nMore severe cases of gastroparesis may occasionally be treated by injecting botulinum toxin into the valve between your stomach and small intestine.\nThis relaxes the valve and keeps it open for a longer period of time so food can pass through.\nThe injection is given through a thin, flexible tube (endoscope) which is passed down your throat and into your stomach.\nThis is a fairly new treatment and some studies have found it may not be very effective, so it's not recommended by all doctors.\nIf you have extremely severe gastroparesis that is not improved with dietary changes or medicine, a feeding tube may be recommended.\nMany different types of temporary and permanent feeding tube are available.\nA temporary feeding tube, called a nasojejunal tube, may be offered to you first. This is inserted into your digestive tract through your nose and delivers nutrients directly into your small intestine.\nA feeding tube can also be inserted into your bowel through a cut (incision) made in your tummy. This is known as a jejunostomy.\nLiquid food can be delivered through the tube, which goes straight to your bowel to be absorbed, bypassing your stomach.\nSpeak to your doctor about the risks and benefits of each type of feeding tube.\nAn alternative feeding method for severe gastroparesis is intravenous (parenteral) nutrition. This is where liquid nutrients are delivered into your bloodstream through a catheter inserted into a large vein.\nSome people may benefit from having an operation to insert a tube into the stomach through the tummy (abdomen). This tube can be periodically opened to release gas and relieve bloating.\nA surgical procedure may be recommended as a last resort to either:\n- create a new opening between your stomach and small intestine (gastroenterostomy)\n- connect your stomach directly to the second part of your small intestine, called the jejunum (gastrojejunostomy)\nThese operations may reduce your symptoms by allowing food to move through your stomach more easily.\nYour doctor can explain whether any procedures are suitable for you, and can discuss the possible risks involved."}, {"Advice for people with diabetes": "Having gastroparesis means your food is being digested slowly and at unpredictable times. If you also have diabetes, this can have a big effect on your blood sugar levels.\nThe nerves to the stomach can be damaged by high levels of blood glucose, so it's important to keep your blood glucose levels under control if you have diabetes.\nYour doctor can advise you about any changes you may need to make to your diet or medicine. For example, if you're taking insulin, you may need to divide your dose before and after meals and inject insulin into areas where absorption is typically slower, such as into your thigh.\nYou'll also need to check your blood glucose levels frequently after you eat."}]}, {"condition": "Gastroscopy", "sections": [{"No header": "- A gastroscopy is a test to check inside your throat, food pipe (oesophagus) and stomach, known as the upper part of your digestive system.\n- This test can help find what's causing your symptoms.\n- A long, thin, flexible tube with a small camera inside it is passed into your mouth then down your throat and into your stomach.\n- A gastroscopy can also be used to remove tissue for testing (biopsy) and treat some conditions such as stomach ulcers."}, {"Your pain relief options": "You\u2019ll be offered medicine called sedation which can make you feel very relaxed and sleepy.

You should be given clear instructions to follow before the operation, including whether you can eat or drink anything in the hours leading up to it.\nJust before you have surgery, you'll usually be taken to a room where your anaesthetist will give you the general anaesthetic. \nIt will either be given as a:\n- liquid that's injected into your veins through a cannula (a thin, plastic tube that feeds into a vein, usually on the back of your hand)\n- gas that you breathe in through a mask\nThe anaesthetic should take effect very quickly. You'll start feeling lightheaded, before becoming unconscious within a minute or so.\nThe anaesthetist will stay with you throughout the procedure. They'll make sure you continue to receive the anaesthetic and that you stay in a controlled state of unconsciousness. They'll also give you painkilling medicine into your veins, so that you're comfortable when you wake up.\nAfter your operation, the anaesthetist will stop the anaesthetic and you'll gradually wake up. You'll usually be in a recovery room at first, before being transferred to a ward.\nDepending on your circumstances, you'll usually need to stay in hospital for a few hours to a few days after your operation.\nGeneral anaesthetics can affect your memory, concentration and reflexes for a day or two, so it's important for a responsible adult to stay with you for at least 24 hours after your operation, if you're allowed to go home. You'll also be advised to avoid driving, drinking alcohol and signing any legal documents for 24 to 48 hours."}, {"Side effects": "General anaesthetics have some common side effects.

It's \"predictive\" because a positive result means you have a greatly increased risk of developing cancer. It does not mean you have cancer or are definitely going to develop it.\nYou may be eligible for this NHS test if the faulty gene has already been identified in one of your relatives, or if there is a strong family history of cancer in your family."}, {"Pros and cons of having a predictive genetic test": "Not everyone who is eligible for the NHS test will want to have it. It's a personal decision, and should only be made after you've had genetic counselling and talked through what having the test means, how you may feel and how you will cope.\nA positive result means you can take steps to manage your risk of developing cancer.\nYou can make certain lifestyle changes to lower your risk, have regular screening and have preventative treatment.\nKnowing the result may reduce any stress and anxiety that comes from not knowing.\nThe results of some genetic tests are inconclusive. This means doctors may identify a variation in a gene, but not know what effect it may have.\nA positive result may cause permanent anxiety. Some people would rather not know about their risk and only want to be told if they actually develop cancer."}, {"What\u00a0testing involves": "There are usually 2 steps to genetic testing:\n- A relative with cancer has a diagnostic blood test to see if they have a cancer risk gene (this must happen before any healthy relatives are tested). Their result will be ready 6 to 8 weeks later.\n- If your relative's test is positive, you can have the predictive genetic test to see if you have the same faulty gene. Your GP will refer you to a local genetics service for a blood test (you'll need a copy of your relative's test results). The result will usually take up to 2 - 4 weeks to come through after a blood sample is taken, but this may not happen at your first appointment. This test is very likely to find the faulty gene but on rare occasions it may miss it.\nWhen there are no affected relatives available, full testing of BRCA1 and BRCA2 may be possible for those with at least a 10% chance of having a faulty gene. This usually means having a very strong family history of early onset breast and particularly ovarian cancer. It can take 4 to 8 weeks or longer to get the result."}, {"What\u00a0a positive result means": "If your predictive genetic test result is positive, it means you have a faulty gene that raises your risk of developing cancer.\nIt does not mean you are guaranteed to get cancer \u2013 your genes only partly influence your future health risks. Other factors, such as your medical history, lifestyle and your environment, also play a role.\nIf you have one of the faulty BRCA genes, there is a 50% chance you will pass this on to any children you have and a 50% chance that each of your siblings also has it.\nYou may want to discuss your results with other members of your family, who may also be affected. Staff at the genetics clinic will discuss with you how a positive or negative result will affect your life and your relationships with your family.\nYou can read more about BRCA1 and BRCA2 in the beginner's guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 (PDF, 866kb) produced by The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust.\nInsurance companies cannot ask you to disclose the results of predictive genetic tests for the majority of policies, but this may change in the future."}, {"Managing your risk": "If your test result is positive, you have a range of options to manage your risk. Risk-reducing surgery is not the only option.\nUltimately, there's no right or wrong answer about what you should do \u2013 it's a decision only you can make.\nIf you have the faulty BRCA1/2 gene, it's a good idea to be aware of changes in your breasts. Find out more about being breast cancer aware.\nThis advice applies to men with a faulty BRCA2 gene too, as they are also at increased risk of breast cancer (although to a lesser extent).\nIn the case of breast cancer, annual breast screening in the form of mammograms and MRI scans can also monitor your condition and catch cancer early, if it does develop.\nDetecting breast cancer at an early stage means it may be easier to treat. The chance of making a full recovery from breast cancer, especially if it is detected early, is relatively high compared with other forms of cancer.\nUnfortunately, there's currently no reliable screening test for ovarian cancer or prostate cancer. Read more about screening for prostate cancer. However, annual PSA tests for prostate cancer may benefit men who carry the faulty BRCA2 gene.\nChanges in your lifestyle can sometimes reduce your individual cancer risk. These include taking plenty of exercise and eating a healthy diet.\nIf you have a faulty BRCA gene, be aware of other factors that could increase your risk of breast cancer. It's recommended that you avoid:\n- theoral contraceptive pill\n- combinedhormone replacement therapy (HRT)\n- drinking more than the maximum recommended daily limits of alcohol\n- being overweight\nThe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) also recommends that women with a family history of breast cancer breastfeed their children, if possible.\nFind out more about things that may help to prevent ovarian cancer.\nNICE recommends medicines called tamoxifen, raloxifene and anastrozole for some women who are at an increased risk of breast cancer.\nThese can reduce your risk of getting breast cancer for many years.\nFind out more about medicine to prevent breast cancer.\nRisk-reducing surgery means removing all the tissue (such as the breasts or ovaries) that could become cancerous. Carriers of a faulty BRCA gene may wish to consider a preventative mastectomy.  \nWomen who have risk-reducing mastectomies reduce their risk of developing breast cancer by around 50%. However, a mastectomy is a major operation and recovering from it can be physically and emotionally difficult.\nSurgery can also be used to reduce ovarian cancer risk. Women who have their ovaries removed before the menopause not only dramatically reduce their chances of developing ovarian cancer, but also reduce their chances of developing breast cancer by up to 50%. However, this will trigger an early menopause and mean you're not able to have your own children (unless you store eggs or embryos). Read more about surgery to remove the ovaries, including the risks and after-effects.\nThe risk of ovarian cancer in women who carry a BRCA gene fault does not begin to rise significantly until about the age of 40. Therefore, carriers of the faulty gene who are younger than 40 usually wait to have this operation."}, {"Telling\u00a0close relatives": "Your genetics unit will not approach your relatives about your result \u2013 it will usually be up to you to tell your family.\nYou may be given a standard letter to share with relatives, which explains your test result and contains all the information they need to be referred for the test themselves.\nHowever, not everyone will want to have the genetic test. Women who are closely related to you (such as your sister or daughter) can have cancer screening without having genetic testing."}, {"Planning a family": "Cancer risk genes can be passed on to any children you have. If your predictive genetic test is positive and you want to start a family, you have several options. You can:\n- have your children without any intervention, and risk your child inheriting the faulty gene\n- adopt a baby\n- use donor eggs or donor sperm (depending on who carries the faulty gene) to avoid passing on the faulty gene\n- discuss prenatal testing with your doctor \u2013 but testing an unborn baby for genes that may cause cancer in later life, using CVS or amniocentesis, is not routinely offered\n- have pre-implantation genetic diagnosis \u2013 a technique used to select embryos that have not inherited the faulty gene; but there's no guarantee this technique will result in a successful pregnancy, and NHS funding for it may not be available to all patients"}, {"Paying\u00a0for private testing": "If there is not a strong family history of cancer in your family and the faulty gene has not otherwise been identified in any of your relatives, you will not be eligible for the NHS genetic test.\nYou'll have to pay for it privately if you still wish to have the test. Consider this carefully, because:\n- if you do not have any family history of cancer, it's less likely you have one of the faulty genes\n- the tests can be expensive, potentially costing around \u00a31,000 or more\n- there's no guarantee they will predict whether you'll develop cancer\n- you may not be offeredgenetic counsellingto help you make a decision and support you once you get your results"}, {"About BRCA1 and BRCA2": "If you have a fault (mutation) in one of the BRCA genes, your risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian cancer is greatly increased.  \nWomen with the faulty BRCA1 gene, for example, have a 65 to 79% lifetime risk of breast cancer and a 36 to 53% risk of ovarian cancer before the age of 80. In other words, out of every 100 women with the faulty BRCA1 gene, between 65 and 79 will develop breast cancer in their lifetime and between 36 and 53 will develop ovarian cancer.\nThe faulty BRCA genes affect around 1 in every 300 to 400 people, but people of Ashkenazi Jewish descent are at a much higher risk (as many as 1 in 40 may carry the faulty gene).\nFor more information, read The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust beginners guide to BRCA1 and BRCA2 on their website."}]}, {"condition": "Genital herpes", "sections": [{"No header": "Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) passed on through vaginal, anal and oral sex.

Regular colonoscopy screening may also be necessary."}, {"Causes of acromegaly": "Acromegaly happens because your pituitary gland (a pea-sized gland just below the brain) produces too much growth hormone.\nThis is usually caused by a non-cancerous tumour in the pituitary gland called an adenoma.\nMost of the symptoms of acromegaly are due to the excess of growth hormone itself, but some come from the tumour pressing on nearby tissues. For example, you may get headaches and vision problems if a tumour pushes against the nearby nerves.\nAcromegaly sometimes runs in families, but most of the time it's not inherited. Adenomas usually spontaneously develop because of a genetic change in a cell of the pituitary gland. This change causes uncontrolled growth of the affected cells, creating the tumour.\nRarely, acromegaly is caused by a tumour in another part of the body, such as the lungs, pancreas or another part of the brain. It may also be linked to some genetic conditions."}, {"Treating acromegaly": "Treatment for acromegaly depends on your symptoms. Usually the goal is to:\n- reduce growth hormone production to normal levels\n- relieve the pressure a tumour may be putting on surrounding tissues\n- treat any hormone deficiencies\n- improve your symptoms\nMost people with acromegaly have surgery to remove a pituitary tumour. Medicine or radiotherapy may sometimes be needed after, or instead of, surgery.\nSurgery is usually effective and can completely cure acromegaly. But sometimes the tumour is too large to be removed entirely, and you may need another operation or further treatment with medicine or radiotherapy.\nUnder general anaesthetic, the surgeon will make a small cut inside your nose or behind your upper lip to access the pituitary gland.\nA long, thin, flexible tube with a light and video camera at one end, called an endoscope, is fed into the opening so your doctor can see the tumour. Surgical instruments are passed through the same opening and used to remove the tumour.\nRemoving the tumour should instantly lower your levels of growth hormone and relieve pressure on the surrounding tissue. Facial features often start to return to normal and swelling improves within a few days.\nWith surgery, there's risk of:\n- damaging the healthy parts of your pituitary gland\n- leakage of the fluid that surrounds and protects your brain\n- meningitis\u2013 although this is rare\nYour surgeon will discuss these risks with you and answer any questions you have.\nMedicine may be prescribed if your growth hormone levels are still higher than normal after surgery, or if surgery was not possible.\n3 different types of medicine are used:\n- a monthly injection of either octreotide, lanreotide or pasireotide\u2013 this slows down the release of growth hormone and can sometimes also shrink tumours\n- a daily pegvisomant injection\u2013 this blocks the effects of growth hormone and can significantly improve symptoms\n- bromocriptine or cabergoline tablets\u2013 these can stop growth hormone being produced, but they only work in a small proportion of people\nEach of these medicines has different advantages and disadvantages. Speak to your doctor about the options available to you, and the benefits and risks of each.\nIf surgery is not possible, or not all of the tumour could be removed, or if medicine has not worked, you may be offered radiotherapy.\nThis can eventually reduce your growth hormone levels, but it may not have a noticeable effect for several years and you may need to take medicine in the meantime.\n2 main types of radiotherapy are used to treat acromegaly:\n- stereotactic radiotherapy\u2013 a high-dose beam of radiation is aimed very precisely at your adenoma; you'll need to wear a rigid head frame or a plastic mask to hold your head still during the treatment, which can usually be done in one session\n- conventional radiotherapy\u2013 this also uses a beam of radiation to target the adenoma, but it's wider and less precise than the one used in stereotactic radiotherapy; this means this treatment can damage the surrounding pituitary gland and brain tissue, so it's given in small doses over 4 to 6 weeks to give your tissues time to heal between treatments\nStereotactic radiotherapy is more commonly used to treat adenomas because it minimises the risk of damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nRadiotherapy can have a number of side effects. It will often cause a gradual drop in the levels of other hormones produced by your pituitary gland, so you'll usually need hormone replacement therapy for the rest of your life. It may also have an effect on your fertility.\nYour doctor will be able to talk to you about these risks and other possible side effects.\nTreatment is often effective at stopping the excessive production of growth hormone and improving the symptoms of acromegaly.\nAfter treatment, you'll need regular follow-up appointments with your specialist for the rest of your life. These will be used to monitor how well your pituitary gland is working, check you're on the correct hormone replacement treatment and make sure the condition does not return."}, {"Diagnosing acromegaly": "Because the symptoms of acromegaly often develop gradually over several years, you may not get a diagnosis straight away. Your doctor may ask you to bring in photographs of yourself that span the past few years to look for the tell-tale gradual changes.\nIf your doctor suspects you have acromegaly, you'll need to have a blood test to measure your growth hormone levels.\nTo make sure the blood test gives an accurate result, you may be asked to drink a sugary solution before having a series of blood samples taken. For people without acromegaly, drinking the solution should stop growth hormone being released. In people with acromegaly, the level of growth hormone in the blood will remain high. This is called a glucose tolerance test.\nYour doctor will also measure the level of another hormone, called insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). A higher level of IGF-1 is a very accurate indication that you may have acromegaly.\nIf your blood tests show a high level of growth hormone and IGF-1, you might have an MRI scan of your brain. This will show where the adenoma is in your pituitary gland and how big it is. If you cannot have an MRI scan, a CT scan can be carried out, but this is less accurate."}, {"National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service": "If you have acromegaly, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThe NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to treat and prevent acromegaly.

Instead, it builds up in the bloodstream, giving the skin and whites of the eyes a yellowish tinge.\nOther than inheriting the faulty gene, there are no known risk factors for developing Gilbert's syndrome. It's not related to lifestyle habits, environmental factors or serious underlying liver problems, such as cirrhosis or hepatitis C."}, {"Triggers of jaundice episodes": "People with Gilbert's syndrome often find there are certain triggers that can bring on an episode of jaundice.\nEpisodes are often linked to things that can cause physical or mental stress including:\n- beingdehydrated\n- going without food for long periods of time (fasting)\n- drinking too much alcohol (keep within the recommended weekly units of alcohol)\n- being ill with an infection\n- heavy physical exertion\n- not getting enough sleep\n- having surgery\n- having aperiod\nWhere possible, avoiding known triggers can reduce your chance of having episodes of jaundice."}, {"Who's affected": "Gilbert's syndrome is common, but it's difficult to know exactly how many people are affected because it does not always cause obvious symptoms.\nIn the UK, it's thought at least 1 in 20 people (probably more) are affected by Gilbert's syndrome. It's more common in people with type 1 diabetes.\nGilbert's syndrome affects more men than women. It's usually diagnosed in a person's late teens or early 20s."}, {"Diagnosing Gilbert's syndrome": "Gilbert's syndrome can be diagnosed using a blood test to measure the levels of bilirubin in your blood and a liver function test.\nWhen the liver is damaged, it releases enzymes into the blood. At the same time, levels of proteins that the liver produces to keep the body healthy begin to drop.\nBy measuring the levels of these enzymes and proteins, it's possible to build up a reasonably accurate picture of how well the liver is functioning.\nIf the test results show you have high levels of bilirubin in your blood, but your liver is otherwise working normally, a confident diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome can usually be made.\nSometimes, a genetic test may be necessary to confirm a diagnosis of Gilbert's syndrome."}, {"Living with Gilbert's syndrome": "Gilbert's syndrome is a lifelong condition. But it does not require treatment because it does not pose a threat to health and does not cause complications or an increased risk of liver disease.\nEpisodes of jaundice and any associated symptoms are usually short-lived and eventually pass.\nChanging your diet or the amount of exercise you do will not affect whether you have the condition.\nBut it's still important to make sure you eat a healthy, balanced diet and get plenty of exercise.\nYou may find it useful to avoid the things you know trigger episodes of jaundice, such as dehydration and stress.\nIf you have Gilbert's syndrome, the problem with your liver may also mean you're at risk of developing jaundice or other side effects after taking certain medicines, such as medicines for high cholesterol like statins.\nYou should talk to a GP before taking any new medicine and make sure you mention that you have Gilbert's syndrome to any doctors treating you for the first time."}]}, {"condition": "Glandular fever", "sections": [{"No header": "Glandular fever mostly affects teenagers and young adults.

It means the body can't process certain amino acids (\"building blocks\" of protein), causing a harmful build-up of substances in the blood and urine.\nNormally, our bodies break down protein foods like meat and fish into amino acids. Any amino acids that aren't needed are usually broken down and removed from the body.\nBabies with GA1 are unable to break down the amino acids lysine, hydroxylysine and tryptophan.\nNormally, these amino acids are broken down into a substance called glutaric acid, which is then converted into energy. Babies with GA1 don't have the enzyme that breaks down glutaric acid, leading to a harmfully high level of this and other substances in the body."}, {"Diagnosing GA1": "At around 5 days old, babies are now offered newborn blood spot screening to check if they have GA1. This involves pricking your baby's heel to collect drops of blood to test.\nIf GA1 is diagnosed, treatment can be given straight away to reduce the risk of serious complications.\nWith early diagnosis and the correct treatment, the majority of children with GA1 are able to live normal, healthy lives. However, treatment for GA1 must be continued for life.\nWithout treatment, severe and life-threatening symptoms can develop, including seizures (fits) or falling into a coma. Some children with untreated GA1 are also at risk of brain damage, which can affect muscle movement. This may lead to problems with walking, talking and swallowing.\nAround 1 in 100,000 children worldwide are thought to be affected by GA1."}, {"Symptoms of GA1": "Symptoms of GA1 usually don't appear until a few months after birth, although some babies are born with a larger-than-average head (macrocephaly).\nChildren with GA1 may develop some floppiness or weakness in their muscles (hypotonia) during their first year and there's a risk of developing bleeding around their brain (subdural haematoma). In rarer cases, bleeding can develop around the back of the eyes (retinal haemorrhage)."}, {"Metabolic crisis": "Children with GA1 may have episodes known as a metabolic crisis, sometimes early in their life. Symptoms of a metabolic crisis include:\n- poor feeding or loss of appetite\n- lack of energy\n- abnormal movements\n- vomiting\n- irritability\n- breathing difficulties\nIt's important to get medical help immediately if your baby develops symptoms of a metabolic crisis. Your doctor will give you advice to help recognise the signs.\nIn some cases, a metabolic crisis may be triggered later in childhood by an infection or illness. The hospital should provide you with emergency treatment instructions to follow if your child is ill, which helps to prevent these symptoms developing."}, {"Treating GA1": "Children diagnosed with GA1 are referred to a specialist metabolic dietitian and given a low-protein diet. This is tailored to reduce the amount of amino acids your baby receives, especially lysine and tryptophan.\nHigh-protein foods need to be limited, including:\n- meat\n- fish\n- cheese\n- eggs\n- pulses\n- nuts\nYour dietitian will provide detailed advice and guidance, as your baby still needs some of these foods for healthy growth and development.\nBreastfeeding and baby milk also need to be monitored and measured, as advised by your dietitian. Regular baby milk contains the amino acids that need to be restricted, so a special formula is used instead. This contains all the vitamins, minerals and other amino acids your baby needs.\nPeople with GA1 may need to follow a restricted protein diet for the rest of their life to reduce their risk of a metabolic crisis. As your child gets older, they'll need to learn how to control their diet and stay in contact with a dietitian for advice and monitoring.\nYour child will be prescribed a medication called L-carnitine, which helps to clear some of the excess glutaric acid.\nL-carnitine is given as a tablet and needs to be taken regularly, as directed by your doctor.\nIf your baby develops an infection, such as a high temperature or cold, their risk of having a metabolic crisis increases. It's possible to reduce the risk by changing to an emergency diet while they're ill.\nYour dietitian will provide detailed instructions, but the aim is to replace milk and food containing protein with special high-sugar drinks. Medication should still be taken as normal.\nYour dietitian may provide you with a feeding tube (nasogastric tube) and show you how to use it safely. This can be useful in an emergency if your baby isn't feeding well while they are ill.\nIf your baby can't keep down their emergency feeds, or develops repeated diarrhoea, you should contact the metabolic team at the hospital to let them know you're heading straight to the accident and emergency (A&E) department.\nYou should also have been provided with a leaflet to bring with you in case of an emergency, in case the doctors haven't seen GA1 before.\nOnce in hospital, your baby can be monitored and treated with intravenous fluids (given directly into a vein).\nYou should also take your baby to hospital if they develop symptoms of a metabolic crisis, such as irritability, loss of energy or breathing difficulties."}, {"How GA1 is inherited": "The genetic cause (mutation) of GA1 is passed on by the parents, who usually don\u2019t have any symptoms of the condition.\nThe way this mutation is passed on is known as autosomal recessive inheritance. This means a baby needs to receive 2 copies of the mutated gene to develop the condition \u2013 1 from their mother and 1 from their father. If the baby only receives 1 mutated gene, they\u2019ll just be a carrier of GA1.\nIf you're a carrier of the affected gene and you have a baby with a partner who's also a carrier, your baby has:\n- a 25% chance of developing the condition\n- a 50% chance of being a carrier of GA1\n- a 25% chance of receiving a pair of normal genes\nAlthough it's not possible to prevent GA1, it's important to let your midwife and doctor know if you have a family history of the condition.
