It's where the male ejaculates too quickly during sexual intercourse.\nA study looking at 500 couples from 5 different countries found the average time taken to ejaculate during intercourse was around 5-and-a-half minutes. However, it's up to each couple to decide if they\u2019re happy with the time taken \u2013 there's no definition of how long sex should last.\nOccasional episodes of premature ejaculation are common and are not a cause for concern. However, if you're finding that around half of your attempts at sex result in premature ejaculation, it might help to get treatment.\nVarious psychological and physical factors can cause a man to suddenly experience premature ejaculation.\nCommon physical causes include:\n- prostate problems\n- thyroid problems\u2013 anoveractiveorunderactive thyroid gland\n- using recreational drugs\nCommon psychological causes include:\n- depression\n- stress\n- relationship problems\n- anxiety about sexual performance(particularly at the start of a new relationship, or when a man has had previous problems with sexual performance)\nIt's possible, but less common, for a man to have always experienced premature ejaculation since becoming sexually active. A number of possible causes for this are:\n- conditioning\u2013 it's possible that early sexual experiences can influence future sexual behaviour. For example, if a teenager conditions himself to ejaculate quickly to avoid being caught masturbating, it may later be difficult to break the habit\n- a traumatic sexual experiencefrom childhood\u2013 this can range from being caught masturbating to sexual abuse\n- a strict upbringing and beliefs about sex\n- biological reasons\u2013 some men may find their penis is extra sensitive\nThere are a number of things you can try yourself before seeking medical help.\nIt can sometimes help to:\n- masturbate an hour or 2 before having sex\n- use a thick condom to help decrease sensation\n- take a deep breath to briefly shut down the ejaculatory reflex (an automatic reflex of the body during which ejaculation occurs)\n- have sex with your partner on top (to allow them to pull away when you are close to ejaculating)\n- take breaks during sex and think about something boring\nIf you're in a long-term relationship, you may benefit from having couples therapy. During these sessions, the therapist will:\n- encourage couples to explore any relationship issues they have, and give them advice about resolving them\n- show the couple techniques that can help you \"unlearn\" the habit of premature ejaculation (the 2 most popular techniques are the \"squeeze\" and \"stop-go\" techniques)\nIn the squeeze technique, your partner masturbates you, but stops before the point of ejaculation and squeezes the head of your penis for between 10 to 20 seconds. They then let go and wait for another 30 seconds before resuming masturbation. This process is carried out several times before ejaculation is allowed to occur.\nThe stop-go technique is similar, but your partner does not squeeze your penis. Once you feel more confident about delaying ejaculation, you and your partner can begin to have sex, stopping and starting as required.\nThese techniques may sound simple, but they require lots of practice.\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are designed to treat depression, but they also delay ejaculation. SSRIs used for this purpose include:\n- paroxetine\n- sertraline\n- fluoxetine\nSome men may experience an improvement as soon as treatment begins. However, you'll usually need to take the medicine for 1 to 2 weeks before you notice the full effects.\nSide effects of SSRIs are usually mild and should improve after 2 to 3 weeks. They include:\n- fatigue\n- feeling sick and being sick\n- diarrhoea\n- excessive sweating\nRead more about the side effects of SSRIs.\nAn SSRI specifically designed to treat premature ejaculation, known as dapoxetine (Priligy), has now been licensed in the UK. Local NHS authorities can choose to prescribe it on the NHS.\nIt acts much faster than the SSRIs mentioned above and can be used \"on demand\". You\u2019ll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day.\nYour response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6), and again every 6 months.\nDapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation. For example, it is not recommended for some men with heart, kidney and liver problems. It can also interact with other medicines, such as other antidepressants.\nCommon side effects include:\n- headaches\n- dizziness\n- feeling sick\nPhosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors, such as sildenafil (sold as Viagra), are a class of medicine used to treat erectile dysfunction. Research has found that they may also help with premature ejaculation.\nBecause of changes in regulations, you no longer need a prescription to get sildenafil. But you will have to have a consultation with the pharmacist to make sure it's safe for you to take it.\nRead more about sildenafil including information on how and when to take it.\nThe use of topical anaesthetics such as lidocaine or prilocaine can help but may be transferred and absorbed to the vagina, causing decreased sensation. Condoms can also be used and are effective, particularly when combined with local anaesthesia."}, {"Delayed ejaculation": "Delayed ejaculation (male orgasmic disorder) is classed as either:\n- experiencing a significant delay before ejaculation\n- being unable to ejaculate at all, even though the man wants to and his erection is normal\nYou may have delayed ejaculation if:\n- you experience a repeated and unwanted delay before ejaculation lasting for 30 to 60 minutes\n- you're unable to ejaculate at least half the times you have sex\nLike premature ejaculation, delayed ejaculation can be caused by psychological and physical factors.\nPossible psychological causes of delayed ejaculation are similar to those of premature ejaculation \u2013 for example, early sexual trauma, strict upbringing, relationship problems, stress or depression.\nPhysical causes of delayed ejaculation include:\n- diabetes(usually onlytype 1 diabetes)\n- spinal cord injuries\n- multiple sclerosis\n- surgery to the bladder or prostate gland\n- increasing age\nMany medicines are known to cause delayed ejaculation, including:\n- antidepressants, particularly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors(SSRIs)\n- medicines to treat high blood pressure, such asbeta-blockers\n- antipsychotics, used to treat episodes of psychosis\n- muscle relaxantssuch as baclofen, which is widely used to treat motor neurone disease and multiple sclerosis\n- powerful painkillers, such as methadone (which is also widely used to treat people addicted to heroin)\nDelayed ejaculation can suddenly start to happen after previously having no problems, or (less commonly) the man may have always experienced it.\nIt can occur in all sexual situations, or only in certain situations. For example, you may be able to ejaculate normally when masturbating, but not during sex. When ejaculation only occurs in certain situations, there's usually a psychological cause.\nSex therapy is a form of counselling that uses a combination of psychotherapy and structured changes in your sex life. This can help to increase your feeling of enjoyment during sex, and help make ejaculation easier.\nSome clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) provide a sex therapy service on the NHS. Availability can vary widely depending on where you live.\nYou can also pay privately. Prices per session are around \u00a350 to \u00a380. The College of Sexual and Relationship Therapists website provides information about private sex therapists and how to find a therapist in your local area.\nThe relationship counselling service Relate also offers sex therapy at a number of its centres. You'll need to pay for each session. \nDuring sex therapy, you'll have the opportunity to discuss any emotional or psychological issues related to your sexuality and relationship, in a non-judgemental way.\nActivities may also be recommended for you to try at home while you're having sex with your partner (you should never be asked to take part in any sexual activities during a session with the therapist).\nThese may include:\n- viewing erotic videos and magazines before having sex to increase the feeling of stimulation\n- erotic fantasies and \"sex games\" to make your lovemaking more exciting\n- using lubricating creams, or jellies, to make the physical act of sex more comfortable and relaxing\n- using sexual aids, such as vibrators, to increase pleasure\nRead more information about what a sex therapist can do.\nThere are a number of medicines that can be used if it's thought SSRIs are responsible for causing delayed ejaculation. These include:\n- amantadine\u2013 originally designed to treat viral infections\n- bupropion\u2013 usually prescribed to help people quit smoking\n- yohimbine\u2013 originally designed to treat erectile dysfunction\nThese help block some of the chemical effects of SSRIs that may contribute towards delayed ejaculation.\nAlcohol misuse and drug use can be separate underlying causes of delayed ejaculation, so addressing these problems may help.\nRead more about getting help with alcohol misuse and drug use.\nPseudoephedrine tablets may be tried, but these will need to be prescribed \"off-label\". This means the medicine shows promise in treating delayed ejaculation but it has not been licensed for this particular use (pseudoephedrine is normally used as a decongestant)."}, {"Retrograde ejaculation": "Retrograde ejaculation is a rarer type of ejaculation problem. It happens when semen travels backwards into the bladder instead of through the urethra (the tube that urine passes through).\nThe main symptoms of retrograde ejaculation include:\n- producing no semen, or only a small amount, during ejaculation\n- producing cloudy urine(because of the semen in it) when you first go to the toilet after having sex\nMen with retrograde ejaculation still experience the feeling of an orgasm and the condition does not pose a danger to health. However, it can affect the ability to father a child.\nRetrograde ejaculation is caused by damage to the nerves or muscles that surround the neck of the bladder (the point where the urethra connects to the bladder).\nUsually when you ejaculate, semen is pushed out of your urethra. It is prevented from entering your bladder by the muscles around the neck of the bladder, which close tightly at the moment of orgasm.\nHowever, damage to the surrounding muscles or nerves can stop the bladder neck closing, causing the semen to move into the bladder rather than up through the urethra.\nProstate gland surgery or bladder surgery is the most common cause of retrograde ejaculation. Other causes are diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and a class of medicines known as alpha blockers, which are often used to treat high blood pressure (hypertension).\nMost men do not need treatment for retrograde ejaculation because they are still able to enjoy a healthy sex life and the condition does not have adverse effects on their health.\nBut if treatment is required (usually because of wanting to father a child), there are options to try.\nFor example, pseudoephedrine (commonly used as a decongestant) has proved effective in treating retrograde ejaculation caused by diabetes or surgery.\nIf retrograde ejaculation is caused by using a certain medicine, then normal ejaculation will usually return once medicine is stopped. Speak to your GP before stopping any prescribed medicine.\nHowever, if the retrograde ejaculation has been caused by significant muscle or nerve damage, treatment may not be possible.\nMen who want to have children can have sperm taken from their urine for use in artificial insemination or in-vitro fertilisation (IVF)."}, {"Involve your partner": "If you're having problems with your sex life and are seeking treatment, it is usually recommended you involve your partner as much as possible.\nCommunicating your concerns can often go a long way to helping to resolve them.

Fat particles can also sometimes develop following severe burns or as a complication of bone surgery.\nEmbolisms can also occur if air bubbles or other gases enter the bloodstream.\nAir embolisms are a particular concern for scuba divers. If a diver swims to the surface too quickly, the change in pressure can cause nitrogen bubbles to form in their bloodstream and become trapped in a blood vessel. This blockage can cause decompression sickness, which is often referred to as \"the bends\".\nIn people with severe atherosclerosis (narrowed arteries caused by a build-up of cholesterol), small pieces of cholesterol can sometimes break away from the side of a blood vessel, resulting in an embolism.\nIn rare cases, amniotic fluid \u2013 which surrounds and protects a baby inside the womb \u2013 can leak into the mother's blood vessels during labour, causing a blockage.

During the operation, the surgeon makes a cut in the affected artery so that the foreign body causing the blockage can be sucked out in a process known as aspiration.\nMedication may be used to dissolve embolisms (thrombolysis) caused by blood clots. Anticoagulant medication, such as warfarin, heparin and low-dose aspirin, can help make the blood less sticky and stop further clots forming.\nEmbolisms caused by air bubbles are usually treated in a hyperbaric chamber. The air pressure inside the chamber is higher than the normal air pressure outside, which helps reduce the size of the air bubbles inside the diver's body."}, {"Preventing embolisms": "It isn't always possible to prevent embolisms, but there are things you can do to significantly reduce your risk.

Dressings, clothing and bedding that have been in contact with an emollient can easily catch fire. Washing fabrics at high temperatures may reduce the build-up of an emollient, but does not remove it completely.\nUse a clean spoon or spatula to remove emollients from a pot or tub. This reduces the risk of infections from contaminated pots.\nBe careful not to slip when using emollients in a bath or shower, or on a tiled floor. Protect the floor with a non-slip mat, towel or sheet.

The tube is then connected to an oxygen supply.\nThis procedure is called a tracheostomy and it allows oxygen to enter the lungs while bypassing the epiglottis.\nAn emergency tracheostomy can be carried out using local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic.\nOnce the airways have been secured and the person is able to breathe unrestricted, a more comfortable and convenient way of assisting breathing may be found.\nThis is usually achieved by threading a tube through the nose and into the windpipe.\nFluids will be supplied through a drip into a vein until the person is able to swallow.\nOnce this has been achieved and the situation is thought to be safe, some tests may be carried out, such as:\n- a fibreoptic laryngoscopy \u2013 a flexible tube with a camera attached to one end (laryngoscope) is used to examine the throat\n- a throat swab \u2013 to test for any bacteria or viruses\n- blood tests\u2013 to check the number of white blood cells (a high number indicates there may an infection) and identify any traces of bacteria or viruses in the blood\n- anX-rayor aCT scan\u2013 sometimes used to check the level of swelling\nAny underlying infection will be treated with a course of antibiotics.\nWith prompt treatment, most people recover from epiglottitis after about a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 7 days."}, {"Why it happens": "Epiglottitis is usually caused by an infection with Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) bacteria.\nAs well as epiglottitis, Hib can cause a number of serious infections, such as pneumonia and meningitis.\nIt spreads in the same way as the cold or flu virus.

If they don't, it could be a sign of a problem.\nThis is a simple test to check whether a newborn baby pays attention to visual objects. \nA midwife or doctor will try to attract your baby's attention with an interesting object. They then move it to see if the child's eyes follow.\nThese sorts of tests can also be used to check the eyesight of older babies and young children who are not yet able to speak. \nIf your child can speak but is not yet able to recognise letters, pictures may be used instead of objects.\nWhen your child can recognise or match letters, their vision is tested using charts that have rows of letters and numbers of decreasing sizes. \nYour child will be asked to read out or match the letters they can see from a specific distance. These charts are called Snellen or LogMAR charts.\nFor younger children, a similar test using pictures or symbols may be carried out instead.\nTo test the range of movement of each eye, a child's attention will be drawn to an interesting object, which is then moved to 8 different positions: up, down, left, right, and halfway between each of these points. \nThis tests how well the eye muscles work.\nA refraction test is carried out by an optometrist at a high-street opticians and is used to check if your child needs glasses and, if so, what prescription they need.\nBefore the test, your child may be given special eyedrops that widen their pupils so the back of their eyes can be examined more clearly. \nYour child will be asked to look at a light, or read letters on a chart if they're old enough, while different lenses are placed in front of their eyes.\nColour vision deficiency tests, also known as colour blindness tests, are usually carried out in older children if a problem is suspected.\nOne of the tests used to check for colour blindness is the Ishihara test. This involves looking at images made up of dots in 2 different colours. If a child's colour vision is normal, they'll be able to recognise a letter or number within the image.\nA child who can't tell the difference between 2 colours won't be able to see the number or letter, which means they may have a colour vision problem. \nRead more about diagnosing colour vision deficiency."}, {"Causes of\u00a0eye problems in babies and children": "There are a number of different eye problems that can be detected during eye tests, including:\n- childhood cataracts\u2013 cloudy patches in the lens of the eye that are present from birth\n- lazy eye (amblyopia)\u2013 where the vision in one eye does not develop properly\n- squint (strabismus)\u2013 where the eyes look in different directions\n- short-sightedness (myopia)\u2013 where distant objects appear blurred, while close objects can be seen clearly\n- long-sightedness (hyperopia)\u2013 where you can see distant objects clearly but nearby objects are out of focus\n- astigmatism\u2013 where the transparent layer at the front of the eye (cornea) is not perfectly curved\n- colour vision deficiency (colour blindness)\u2013 difficulty seeing colours or distinguishing between different colours; this is more common in boys than girls"}, {"Spotting\u00a0signs of\u00a0an eye problem": "Although your child should have regular eye tests as they grow up, it's still important to look out for signs of any problems and get advice if you have any concerns.\nFor babies, the checklist in your baby's personal child health record (red book) can be used to help you check if your child's vision is developing normally.\nIn older children, signs of a possible eye problem can include:\n- the eyes not pointing in the same direction\n- complaining ofheadachesor eye strain\n- problems reading \u2013 for example, they may need to hold books close to their face and they may lose their place regularly\n- problems with hand-eye co-ordination \u2013 for example, they may struggle to play ball games\n- being unusually clumsy\n- regularly rubbing their eyes\n- sitting too close to the TV\nSpeak to a GP or go to an opticians if you have any concerns about your child's eyes or vision. The earlier a problem is picked up the better.\nChildren can have an eyesight test at any age. They do not need to be able to read, or even speak. An eyesight test is particularly important if there's a history of childhood eye problems, such as squint or lazy eye, in your family."}]}, {"condition": "Eyelid problems", "sections": [{"No header": "Find out what to do if you have a lump on your eyelid, or an eyelid that's swollen, sticky, itchy, drooping or twitching."}, {"Most eyelid problems are harmless": "Many eyelid problems are not serious.\nIt's fairly common to have any of these problems:\n- a lump that goes away by itself after 3 or 4 weeks\n- mildly itchy, flaky or sticky eyelids that clear up by themselves\n- swelling from a nearby insect bite, injury or operation that goes away after a week or so\n- twitching or blinking from time to time \u2013 often when you're tired\n- eyelids that droop (or get more \"hooded\") as you get older"}, {"Types of eyelid problems": "Your symptoms might give you an idea of the cause.
