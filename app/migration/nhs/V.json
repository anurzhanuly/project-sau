It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin.\nVitiligo can affect any area of skin, but it commonly happens on the face, neck and hands, and in skin creases.\nThe pale areas of skin are more vulnerable to sunburn, so it's important to take extra care when in the sun and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF)."}, {"Symptoms of vitiligo": "The areas of skin most commonly affected by vitiligo include:\n- mouth and eyes\n- fingers and wrists\n- armpits\n- groin\n- genitals\n- inside your mouth\nIt can also sometimes develop where there are hair roots, such as on your scalp. The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey.\nVitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white.\nThe edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular. They're sometimes red and inflamed, or there's brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation).\nVitiligo does not cause discomfort to your skin, such as dryness, but the patches may occasionally be itchy.\nThe condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches, but others get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin.\nThere's no way of predicting how much skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent.\nThere are 2 main types of vitiligo:\n- non-segmental vitiligo\n- segmental vitiligo\nIn rare cases, it's possible for vitiligo to affect your whole body. This is known as universal or complete vitiligo.\nIn non-segmental vitiligo (also called bilateral or generalised vitiligo), the symptoms often appear on both sides of your body as symmetrical white patches.\nSymmetrical patches can appear on the:\n- backs of your hands\n- arms\n- skin around body openings, such as the eyes\n- knees\n- elbows\n- feet\nNon-segmental vitiligo is the most common type of vitiligo, affecting around 9 in 10 people with the condition.\nIn segmental vitiligo (also known as unilateral or localised vitiligo), the white patches only affect one area of your body.\nSegmental vitiligo is less common than non-segmental vitiligo, although it's more common in children. It usually starts earlier and affects 3 in 10 children with vitiligo."}, {"What causes vitiligo?": "Vitiligo is caused by the lack of a pigment called melanin in the skin. Melanin is produced by skin cells called melanocytes, and it gives your skin its colour.\nIn vitiligo, there are not enough working melanocytes to produce enough melanin in your skin. This causes white patches to develop on your skin or hair. It's not clear exactly why the melanocytes disappear from the affected areas of skin.\nNon-segmental vitiligo (the most common type) is thought to be an autoimmune condition.\nIn autoimmune conditions, the immune system does not work properly. Instead of attacking foreign cells, such as viruses, your immune system attacks your body's healthy cells and tissue.\nIf you have non-segmental vitiligo, your immune system destroys the melanocyte skin cells that make melanin.\nVitiligo is also associated with other autoimmune conditions, such as hyperthyroidism (an overactive thyroid gland), but not everyone with vitiligo will develop these conditions.\nYou may be at increased risk of developing non-segmental vitiligo if:\n- other members of your family have it\n- there's a family history of other autoimmune conditions \u2013 for example, if one of your parents has pernicious anaemia (an autoimmune condition that affects the stomach)\n- you have another autoimmune condition\n- you havemelanoma(a type of skin cancer) ornon-Hodgkin lymphoma(cancer of the lymphatic system)\n- you have particular changes in your genes that are known to be linked to non-segmental vitiligo\nSegmental vitiligo (the less common type) is thought to be caused by chemicals released from the nerve endings in your skin. These chemicals are poisonous to the melanocyte skin cells.\nIt's possible that vitiligo may be triggered by particular events, such as:\n- stressful events, such as childbirth\n- skin damage, such as severe sunburn or cuts (this is known as the Koebner response)\n- exposure to certain chemicals \u2013 for example, at work\nVitiligo is not caused by an infection and you cannot catch it from someone else who has it."}, {"Diagnosing vitiligo": "A GP will be able to diagnose vitiligo after examining the affected areas of skin.\nThey may ask you if:\n- there's a history of vitiligo in your family\n- there's a history of other autoimmune conditions in your family\n- you've injured the affected areas of skin \u2013 for example, whether you've had sunburn or a severe rash there\n- you tan easily in the sun, or whether you burn\n- any areas of skin have got better without treatment, or whether they're getting worse\n- you've tried any treatments already\nA GP may also ask you about the impact vitiligo has on your life. For example, how much it affects your confidence and self-esteem, and whether it affects your job.\nIf available, the GP may use an ultraviolet (UV) lamp called a Wood's lamp to look at your skin in more detail. You'll need to be in a dark room and the lamp will be held 10 to 13cm away from your skin.\nThe patches of vitiligo will be easier to see under UV light, which will help the GP distinguish vitiligo from other skin conditions, such as pityriasis versicolor (where there's a loss of pigment due to a fungal infection).\nAs non-segmental vitiligo is closely associated with other autoimmune conditions, you may be assessed to see whether you have any symptoms that could suggest an autoimmune condition, such as:\n- being tired and lacking energy, which may be a sign ofAddison's disease\n- being thirsty and needing to urinate often, which may be a sign ofdiabetes\nA blood test may also be needed to check how well your thyroid gland is working."}, {"Treating vitiligo": "If vitiligo is severe or making you unhappy, you may want to consider treatment.\nThe white patches caused by vitiligo are usually permanent, although treatment options are available to reduce their appearance.\nIf the patches are relatively small, skin camouflage cream can be used to cover them up.\nSteroid creams can also be used on the skin to restore some pigment, however long-term use can cause stretch marks and thinning of the skin\nIf steroid creams do not work, phototherapy (treatment with light) may be used.\nAlthough treatment may help restore colour to your skin, the effect does not usually last. Treatment cannot stop the condition spreading.\nFind out more about treating vitiligo."}, {"Complications of vitiligo": "Vitiligo can sometimes cause other problems.\nBecause of a lack of melanin, your skin will be more vulnerable to the effects of the sun. Make sure you use a strong sunscreen to avoid sunburn.\nVitiligo may also be associated with eye problems, such as inflammation of the iris, inflammation of the middle layer of the eye (uveitis), and a partial loss of hearing (hypoacusis).\nProblems with confidence and self-esteem are common in people with vitiligo, particularly if it affects areas of skin that are frequently exposed."}, {"Help and support": "Support groups can provide help and advice and may be able to put you in contact with other people with vitiligo.

This can start at any age and is usually associated with other conditions that affect the blood, immune system or heart."}, {"How\u00a0von Willebrand disease is inherited": "VWD is often caused by a fault in the gene involved in the production of von Willebrand factor.\nThe type of VWD a person is born with mostly depends on whether they inherit copies of this faulty gene from 1 or both parents.\n- If a parent has a genetic fault that causes VWD\u2013 there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child having type 1 or type 2 VWD, and no chance of them having type 3 VWD.\n- If both parents have a fault in the VWD gene\u2013 there's a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of a child being a carrier like their parents and a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of them having type 3 VWD.\nThe chances of inheriting type 1 VWD can also be affected by other things, including blood group. People with blood group O are more often affected than people with blood group A or B.\nThis means it's not always easy to predict whether a child might inherit it from their parents.\nParents who are carriers of a faulty VWF gene may not have symptoms themselves.\nSpeak to your specialist if you have VWD and are thinking about having a baby. If you have a family history of VWD and think you might be affected, you should ideally have tests before you get pregnant."}, {"Pregnancy\u00a0and von Willebrand disease": "You can have children if you have VWD, even if it's severe. But there's a risk of:\n- your child being born with VWD\n- you having heavy bleeding during or after labour\nSpeak to your doctor about your options if you're planning to have a baby. They may suggest genetic testing to see if your baby is at risk of being born with VWD.\nYou can also have tests towards the end of your pregnancy to check the level of von Willebrand factor in your blood. Medicine to help prevent bleeding during labour will be offered if your level is low.\nYou'll probably be advised to give birth in a specialist hospital in case there are any problems. Most women can give birth either vaginally or by caesarean section. It's rare for babies with VWD to have any problems with bleeding during birth."}, {"National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service": "If you have VWD, your clinical team will pass information about you on to the National Congenital Anomaly and Rare Disease Registration Service (NCARDRS).\nThe NCARDRS helps scientists look for better ways to prevent and treat VWD.
