depend on where in the body the tumour develops:\n- a tumour in the bowel may causetummy pain, a blocked bowel (diarrhoea,constipation, feeling sick or being sick) andbleeding from the bottom (rectal bleeding)\n- a tumour in the lung may cause acough, which may make youcough up blood, and cause wheezing,shortness of breath,chest painand tiredness\n- a tumour in the stomach may cause pain, weight loss, tiredness and weakness\nSome tumours may not cause any symptoms and are discovered by chance.\nFor example, a tumour in the appendix may only be found when the appendix is being removed for another reason.\nTypical symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include:\n- diarrhoea, tummy pain and loss of appetite\n- flushing of the skin, particularly the face\n- fast heart rate\n- breathlessness and wheezing\nThese symptoms may come on unexpectedly, as the hormones can be produced by the tumour at any time.\nSome people may also develop carcinoid heart disease, where the heart valves thicken and

A second dose is usually given 24 hours after the first.\nThe steroids stimulate the development of the baby's lungs. It's estimated that the treatment helps prevent NRDS in a third of premature births.\nYou may also be offered magnesium sulphate to reduce the risk of developmental problems linked to being born early.\nIf you take magnesium sulphate for more than 5 to 7 days or several times during your pregnancy, your newborn baby may be offered extra checks. This is because prolonged use of magnesium sulphate in pregnancy has in rare cases been linked to bone problems in newborn babies.\nYour baby may be transferred to a ward that provides specialist care for premature babies (a neonatal unit).\nIf the symptoms are mild, they may only need extra oxygen. It's usually given through an incubator, a small mask over their nose or face or tubes into their nose.\nIf symptoms are more severe, your baby will be attached to a breathing machine (ventilator) to either support or take over their breathing.\nThese treatments are often started immediately in the delivery room before transfer to the neonatal unit.\nYour baby may also be given a dose of artificial surfactant, usually through a breathing tube.\nEvidence suggests early treatment within 2 hours of delivery is more beneficial than if treatment is delayed.\nThey'll also be given fluids and nutrition through a tube connected to a vein.\nSome babies with NRDS only need help with breathing for a few days. But some, usually those born extremely prematurely, may need support for weeks or even months.\nPremature babies often have multiple problems that keep them in hospital, but generally they're well enough to go home around their original expected delivery date.\nThe length of time your baby needs to stay in hospital will depend on how early they were born."}, {"Complications of NRDS": "Most babies with NRDS can be successfully treated, although they have a high risk of developing further problems later in life.\nAir can sometimes leak out of the baby's lungs and become trapped in their chest cavity. This is known as a pneumothorax.\nThe pocket of air places extra pressure on the lungs, causing them to collapse and leading to additional breathing problems.\nAir leaks can be treated by inserting a tube into the chest to allow the trapped air to escape.\nBabies with NRDS may have bleeding inside their lungs (pulmonary haemorrhage) and brain (cerebral haemorrhage).\nBleeding into the lungs is treated with air pressure from a ventilator to stop the bleeding and a blood transfusion.\nBleeding into the brain is quite common in premature babies, but most bleeds are mild and do not cause long-term problems.\nSometimes ventilation (begun within 24 hours of birth) or the surfactant used to treat NRDS causes scarring to the baby's lungs, which affects their development.\nThis lung scarring is called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD).\nSymptoms of BPD include rapid, shallow breathing and shortness of breath.\nBabies with severe BPD usually need additional oxygen from tubes into their nose to help with their breathing.\nThis is usually stopped after a few months, when the lungs have healed.\nBut children with BPD may need regular medicine, such as bronchodilators, to help widen their airways and make breathing easier.\nIf the baby's brain is damaged during NRDS, either because of bleeding or a lack of oxygen, it can lead to long-term developmental disabilities, such as learning difficulties, movement problems, impaired hearing and impaired vision.\nBut these developmental problems are not usually severe.

When you are invited for screening, you will receive an information leaflet about the screening test.\nYou can discuss any aspect of the screening test with your health professional and decide whether or not it's right for you.\nDifferent types of screening have different benefits and risks. Some of these are listed below.\n- Screening can detect a problem early, before you have any symptoms.\n- Finding out about a problem early can mean that treatment is more effective.\n- Finding out you have a health problem or an increased chance of a health problem can help people make better informed decisions about their health.\n- Screening can reduce the chance of developing a condition or its complications.\n- Some deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms, bowel cancer, breast cancer and cervical cancer can be prevented.\n- Screening tests are not 100% accurate. You could be told you have a problem when you do not \u2013 this is called a \"false positive\" and may lead to some people having unnecessary further tests or treatment as a result of screening. A screening test could also miss a problem \u2013 this is called a \"false negative\" and could lead to people ignoring symptoms in the future.\n- Some screening tests can lead to difficult decisions. For example, if a pregnancy screening test tells you your baby has a higher chance of having a particular condition, you may then be faced with a decision about having further diagnostic tests that involve a risk to your pregnancy. If the diagnostic test is positive, you may then need to decide whether to continue with your pregnancy.\n- Finding out you may have a health problem can cause considerable anxiety.\n- Even if your screening test result is normal or negative (meaning you are not at high risk), you could still go on to develop the condition.\nAn expert group called the UK National Screening Committee (UK NSC) advises the NHS on which screening programmes to offer.\nWhen considering who to screen and which conditions to screen for, the benefits of offering a screening programme are weighed up against the harms. The UK NSC only recommends screening when it believes the benefits to the group offered screening outweigh the harms.\nThe UK NSC regularly reviews its recommendations on screening for different conditions as new research becomes available. This is usually done every 3 years.\nFind out how the UK NSC reviews evidence and monitors the quality of screening programmes.\nAll screening tests provided by the NHS are free. Private companies offer a range of screening tests that you have to pay for. Some of the tests on offer are not recommended by the UK NSC because it is not clear that the benefits outweigh the harms.\nThe UK NSC has produced a downloadable leaflet on private screening."}, {"Confidentiality and use of data": "By law, everyone working in, or on behalf of, the NHS must respect your privacy and keep all information about you safe.
