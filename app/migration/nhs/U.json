They usually take place in a hospital radiology department and are performed either by a doctor, radiographer or a sonographer.\nThey can also be carried out in community locations such as GP practices, and may be performed by other healthcare professionals, such as midwives or physiotherapists who have been specially trained in ultrasound.\nThere are different kinds of ultrasound scans, depending on which part of the body is being scanned and why.\nThe 3 main types are:\n- external ultrasound scan \u2013 the probe is moved over the skin\n- internal ultrasound scan \u2013 the probe is inserted into the body\n- endoscopic ultrasound scan \u2013 the probe is attached to a long, thin, flexible tube (anendoscope) and passed further into the body\nThese techniques are described below.\nAn external ultrasound scan is most often used to examine the heart or an unborn baby in the womb.\nIt can also be used to examine the liver, kidneys and other organs in the tummy and pelvis, as well as other organs or tissues that can be assessed through the skin, such as muscles and joints.\nA small handheld probe is placed on your skin and moved over the part of your body being examined.\nA lubricating gel is put on your skin to allow the probe to move smoothly. This also ensures there's continuous contact between the probe and the skin.\nYou shouldn't feel anything other than the sensor and gel on your skin (which is often cold).\nIf you're having a scan of your womb or pelvic area, you may have a full bladder that causes you a little discomfort.\nThere will be a toilet nearby to empty your bladder once the scan is complete.\nAn internal examination allows a doctor to look more closely inside the body at organs such as the prostate gland, ovaries or womb.\nA \"transvaginal\" ultrasound means \"through the vagina\". During the procedure, you'll be asked to either lie on your back, or on your side with your knees drawn up towards your chest.\nA small ultrasound probe with a sterile cover, not much wider than a finger, is then gently passed into the vagina or rectum and images are transmitted to a monitor.\nInternal examinations may cause some discomfort, but don't usually cause any pain and shouldn't take very long.\nDuring an endoscopic ultrasound scan, an endoscope is inserted into your body, usually through your mouth, to examine areas such as your stomach or food pipe (oesophagus).\nYou'll usually be asked to lie on your side as the endoscope is carefully pushed down towards your stomach.\nThe endoscope has a light and an ultrasound device on the end. Once it's been inserted into the body, sound waves are used to create images in the same way as an external ultrasound.\nYou'll usually be given a sedative to keep you calm and local anaesthetic spray to numb your throat, as an endoscopic ultrasound scan can be uncomfortable and may make you feel sick. \nYou may also be given a mouth guard to keep your mouth open and protect your teeth, in case you bite the endoscope."}, {"After an ultrasound scan": "In most cases, there are no after-effects and you can go home soon after the scan is finished.\nIf a sedative wasn't used, you can drive, eat, drink and return to your other normal activities straightaway.\nIf you had an endoscopic ultrasound and were given a sedative to help you relax, you'll usually be advised to stay in hospital for a few hours until the medication starts to wear off.\nYou'll need to arrange for someone to pick you up from the hospital and stay with you for the next 24 hours.\nYou shouldn't drive, drink alcohol or operate machinery during this time.\nYou may be told the results of your scan soon after it's been carried out, but in most cases the images will need to be analysed and a report will be sent to the doctor who referred you for the scan.\nThey'll discuss the results with you a few days later or at your next appointment, if one's been arranged."}, {"Are there any risks or side effects?": "There are no known risks from the sound waves used in an ultrasound scan. Unlike some other scans, such as CT scans, ultrasound scans don't involve exposure to radiation.\nExternal and internal ultrasound scans don't have any side effects and are generally painless, although you may experience some discomfort as the probe is pressed over your skin or inserted into your body.\nIf you're having an internal scan and are allergic to latex, it's important to let the sonographer or doctor carrying out the scan know this so they can use a latex-free probe cover.\nEndoscopic ultrasounds can be a bit more uncomfortable and can cause temporary side effects, such as a sore throat or bloating.\nThere's also a small risk of more serious complications, such as internal bleeding."}]}, {"condition": "Umbilical hernia repair", "sections": [{"No header": "A hernia is where an internal part of the body pushes through a weakness in the muscle or surrounding tissue wall.\nYour muscles are usually strong and tight enough to keep your organs and intestines in place, but a hernia can develop if there are any weak spots."}, {"Umbilical hernias": "Umbilical hernias are very common in infants and young children, particularly in babies born prematurely.\nAn umbilical hernia appears as a painless lump in or near the belly button (navel). \nIt may get bigger when laughing, coughing, crying or going to the toilet and may shrink when relaxing or lying down.\nIn many cases, the umbilical hernia goes back in and the muscles reseal by the time a child is 4 or 5 years old.\nUmbilical hernias can also develop in adults.

The procedures that are suitable for you will depend on the type of incontinence you have.\nSurgical treatment for stress incontinence, such as a sling procedure, is used to reduce pressure on the bladder or strengthen the muscles that control urination.\nSurgery to treat urge incontinence includes enlarging the bladder or implanting a device that stimulates the nerve that controls the detrusor muscles.\nFind out more about surgery and procedures for urinary incontinence."}, {"Preventing urinary incontinence": "It's not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence, but there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it happening.\nThese include:\n- maintaining a healthy weight\n- avoiding or cutting down on alcohol\n- staying active \u2013 in particular, ensuring that your pelvic floor muscles are strong\nBeing obese can increase your risk of urinary incontinence. You may be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating.\nUse the healthy weight calculator to see if you are a healthy weight for your height.\nGet more information and advice about losing weight.\nDepending on your particular bladder problem, a GP can advise you about the amount of fluids you should drink.\nIf you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder.\nThe recommended weekly limit for alcohol consumption is 14 units.\nA unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.\nFind out more about alcohol units.\nIf you have to urinate frequently during the night (nocturia), try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. However, make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day.\nBeing pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder.
