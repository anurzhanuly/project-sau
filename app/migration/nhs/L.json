They can usually be gently pulled apart by hand, or a small blunt probe can be used.\nA surgical separation is usually performed under a general anaesthetic, where you're asleep, or local anaesthetic, where the area is numbed, as the procedure can be quite painful and can cause distress.\nTo allow the labial edges to heal properly and prevent another labial fusion forming, it's advised to apply an emollient, such as nappy rash cream or Vaseline, to the labia for a few weeks afterwards.\nThere's a high chance the fusion will return after treatment, whether it's with oestrogen cream or surgery."}, {"Complications of labial fusion": "Labial fusion is not linked to any medical condition and has no long-term implications for your child.\nIt will not affect her future fertility or sexual life.

This breaks down lactose into 2 sugars called glucose and galactose, which can be easily absorbed into the bloodstream.\nPeople with lactose intolerance do not produce enough lactase, so lactose stays in the digestive system, where it's fermented by bacteria.\nThis leads to the production of various gases, which cause the symptoms associated with lactose intolerance.\nDepending on the underlying reason why the body's not producing enough lactase, lactose intolerance may be temporary or permanent.\nMost cases that develop in adults are inherited and tend to be lifelong, but cases in young children are often caused by an infection in the digestive system and may only last for a few weeks.\nIn the UK, lactose intolerance is more common in people of Asian or African-Caribbean descent.\nLactose intolerance can develop at any age. Many cases first develop in people aged 20 to 40, although babies and young children can also be affected."}, {"Is it an allergy?": "Lactose intolerance is not the same as a milk or dairy allergy. Food allergies are caused by your immune system reacting to a certain type of food.

This often helps correct a squint as well.\nThe child is then encouraged to use the affected eye again. This can be done using an eye patch to cover the stronger eye, or eyedrops to temporarily blur the vision in the stronger eye.\nTreatment is a gradual process that takes many months to work.

If you stop drinking alcohol for 2 weeks, your liver should return to normal.\nAlcoholic hepatitis, which is unrelated to infectious hepatitis, is a potentially serious condition that can be caused by alcohol misuse over a longer period.\nWhen this develops, it may be the first time a person is aware they're damaging their liver through alcohol.\nLess commonly, alcoholic hepatitis can occur if you drink a large amount of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drinking).\nThe liver damage associated with mild alcoholic hepatitis is usually reversible if you stop drinking permanently.\nSevere alcoholic hepatitis, however, is a serious and life-threatening illness.\nMany people die from the condition each year in the UK, and some people only find out they have liver damage when their condition reaches this stage.\nCirrhosis is a stage of ARLD where the liver has become significantly scarred. Even at this stage, there may not be any obvious symptoms.\nIt's generally not reversible, but stopping drinking alcohol immediately can prevent further damage and significantly increase your life expectancy.\nA person who has alcohol-related cirrhosis and does not stop drinking has a less than 50% chance of living for at least 5 more years."}, {"Treating alcohol-related liver disease (ARLD)": "There's currently no specific medical treatment for ARLD.

are also available on prescription or over the counter from pharmacies.\nDepending on what they're being used for, local anaesthetics can be given as injections, creams, gels, sprays or ointments.\nSome of the main uses of local anaesthetics are outlined on this page.\nSlightly painful conditions, such as mouth ulcers and sore throats, can sometimes be treated with over-the-counter gels and sprays that contain a local anaesthetic.\nInjections of a local anaesthetic and steroid medicine may be used to treat more severe conditions, such as long-term joint pain. \nA local anaesthetic, usually given by injection, may be used along with a sedative medicine to keep you relaxed while an operation or procedure is carried out.\nLocal anaesthetics are mainly used for relatively minor procedures, such as:\n- a filling orwisdom tooth removal\n- a minor skin operation, such as the removal ofmoles,warts and verrucas\n- some types of eye surgery, such ascataract removal\n- abiopsy(where a sample of tissue is removed for closer examination under a microscope)\nA local anaesthetic may occasionally be used for more major surgery when it's important for you to be awake, such as during certain types of brain surgery, or to prevent pain after a major operation that's been carried out under a general anaesthetic.\nAn epidural anaesthetic, often referred to as an epidural, is where a local anaesthetic is continually injected through a tube into an area of the lower back called the epidural space.\nA spinal anaesthetic is a single injection into a similar space in the back.\nBoth types of anaesthetic can be used to numb large areas of the body by stopping pain signals travelling along the nerves in the spine.\nThey're often used during childbirth to ease the pain of labour or if a caesarean section is needed.\nThey can also be used to reduce the amount of general anaesthesia needed during some operations and can provide pain relief afterwards.\nIn some types of surgery, such as knee and hip replacements, they can be used in place of a general anaesthetic.\nA nerve block is an injection of a local anaesthetic to numb the nerves supplying a particular part of the body, such as the hand, arm or leg.\nIt may be used so an operation can be carried out without needing a general anaesthetic, or to prevent pain afterwards.\nAn ultrasound scan is often used to pinpoint the correct nerve.\nThe injection shouldn't be painful and usually takes about 30 minutes to become fully effective.\nWhen peripheral nerve blocks and epidural or spinal anaesthetics are used in place of general anaesthetics, they're often combined with sedation to make you feel drowsy and more relaxed."}, {"Risks and side effects": "Local anaesthetics are generally very safe and serious problems are rare.\nYou may have:\n- some discomfort when the injection is given\n- a tingling sensation as the medicine wears off\n- possibly some minor bruising, bleeding or soreness where the injection was given\nYou shouldn't experience any significant side effects.\nYou should move carefully until the anaesthetic has worn off as you may not notice if you injure yourself.\nSome people experience temporary side effects from a local anaesthetic, such as:\n- dizziness\n- headaches\n- blurred vision\n- twitching muscles or shivering\n- continuing numbness, weakness orpins and needles\n- finding it hard to pee or leaking pee (epidural)\nThese problems will usually pass, but you should tell the healthcare professional in charge of your care if you experience any.\nIn very

body)."}]}, {"condition": "Long QT syndrome", "sections": [{"No header": "Long QT syndrome is an inherited heart problem that affects how your heart beats.

This is called cardiac arrest, and the heart rarely returns to normal if it is not electrically corrected with shock.\nCall 999 for an ambulance if someone with long QT syndrome suddenly collapses and does not regain consciousness.

If you have long QT syndrome, the trace of the QT section (showing part of the heartbeat) will be longer than normal. Sometimes an exercise ECG will be needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nGenetic testing may be needed to identify the faulty gene causing long QT syndrome. It can also help identify other family members who may have inherited the faulty gene and need clinical assessment."}, {"Treating long QT syndrome": "Most people with inherited long QT syndrome will need treatment with medicines. Beta blockers, such as propranolol or nadolol, may be prescribed to help control irregular heartbeats and slow down your heart rate.\nIf your symptoms are frequent or severe, and you have a high risk of having a life-threatening arrhythmia, you may need to have a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) fitted.\nIn some cases of long QT syndrome, surgery may be needed to control the flow of chemicals into the heart.

However, you may need to make some lifestyle adjustments to reduce your risk of having blackouts.\nFor example, you may not be able to exercise strenuously or play competitive sports, and may need to try to avoid startling noises, such as alarm clocks. Avoiding stressful situations may also be recommended.\nRehydrating properly after a tummy upset is also essential, usually with supplements containing salt and sugar.\nYour doctor may prescribe potassium supplements or suggest increasing the amount of potassium-rich foods in your diet.

Secondary lymphoedema is much more common.\nSecondary lymphoedema affects around 2 in 10 people with breast cancer, and 5 in 10 people with vulval cancer. About 3 in every 10 people with penile cancer get lymphoedema.\nPeople who have treatment for melanoma in the lymph nodes in the groin can also get lymphoedema.\nYour treatment team will let you know if you're at risk of getting lymphoedema from your cancer or cancer treatment. Any planned treatment you have will try to avoid causing damage to your lymph nodes.\nCancer Research UK has more information about lymphoedema and cancer."}, {"Diagnosing lymphoedema": "See a GP if you experience the typical symptoms of lymphoedema, such as swelling in your arms and legs. They may refer you to a specialist lymphoedema treatment centre for further assessment.\nIn many cases, lymphoedema can be diagnosed from your symptoms and medical history, and by examining the affected body part and measuring the distance around it to see if it's enlarged.\nOccasionally, further tests may be necessary to assess and monitor your condition.\nRead more about diagnosing lymphoedema"}, {"Treating lymphoedema": "There's no cure for lymphoedema, but it's usually possible to control the main symptoms using techniques to minimise fluid build-up and stimulate the flow of fluid through the lymphatic system.\nThese include wearing compression garments, taking good care of your skin, moving and exercising regularly, having a healthy diet and lifestyle, and using specialised massage techniques.\nRead more about treating lymphoedema and preventing lymphoedema."}, {"Complications": "Cellulitis is the most common complication of lymphoedema. It can also have a significant psychological impact. It can be serious if it's not treated quickly.\nIf you have lymphoedema, the build-up of fluid in your tissues makes you more vulnerable to infection.\nCellulitis is a bacterial infection of the deep layer of skin (dermis) that often affects people with lymphoedema. Cellulitis can also sometimes cause lymphoedema.\nSymptoms of cellulitis can include:\n- redness and a feeling of heat in the skin\n- pain and increased swelling in the affected area\n- a high temperature\n- chills\nAntibiotics taken by mouth (orally) can usually be used to treat cellulitis, although severe cases may need to be treated in hospital with antibiotics given directly into a vein (intravenously).\nLiving with a long-term condition that affects your appearance can cause a great deal of distress and lead to periods of depression.\nYou may be depressed if you've been feeling down for the past few months and no longer find pleasure in things you usually enjoy.\nIf this is the case, talk to a GP or a member of your lymphoedema treatment team. Effective treatments are available for depression.\nTalking to other people with lymphoedema can be reassuring and decrease feelings of isolation, stress and anxiety.\nThe Lymphoedema Support Network provides information and advice, and can put you in touch with a support group in your area.\nIf you persevere with your treatment plan, your symptoms should eventually become less noticeable."}, {"Video: lymphoedema - Philippa's story": "In this video, Philippa describes how she lives with primary lymphoedema."}]}]
