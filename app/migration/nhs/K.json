Without treatment, most types of Kaposi's sarcoma get worse quickly, in a number of weeks or months.

A sample of affected tissue is taken so it can be checked under a microscope. The procedure is usually done under local anaesthetic.\nYou'll need to have an endoscopy if it's thought you have Kaposi's sarcoma in your digestive system.\nA long, thin, flexible tube with a light and camera at one end (an endoscope) is passed down your throat so the inside of your body can be examined.\nSometimes a CT scan may also be done to check whether your lymph nodes, or any other parts of your body, are affected."}, {"What causes Kaposi's sarcoma?": "Kaposi's sarcoma is caused by a virus called the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), also known as the Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV).\nThe virus is thought to be spread during sex, through blood or saliva, or from a mother to her baby during birth.\nHHV-8 is a relatively common virus, and most people who have it will not develop Kaposi's sarcoma. \nThe virus only seems to cause cancer in some people with a weakened immune system, and people who have a genetic vulnerability to the virus.\nA weakened immune system allows the HHV-8 virus to multiply to high levels in the blood, increasing the chance of it causing Kaposi's sarcoma.\nThe virus appears to alter the genetic instructions that control cell growth. It affects the cells that line the inside surface of blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, called endothelial cells.\nThe endothelial cells reproduce uncontrollably and form lumps of tissue known as tumours."}, {"Treating Kaposi's sarcoma": "There are 4 main types of Kaposi's sarcoma, and each type is treated in a different way.\nKaposi's sarcoma is one of the main types of cancer to affect people with HIV. It can progress very quickly if it is not treated.\nIt can usually be treated very effectively by taking HIV medicine known as combination antiretroviral therapy (cART).\nThis prevents HIV multiplying and allows the immune system to recover. The immune system can then reduce the levels of HHV-8 in the body.\nSome people may also need other treatments, such as chemotherapy or a medicine called interferon.\nClassic Kaposi's sarcoma is very rare, and mainly affects the skin on the lower legs and feet.\nUnlike other types of Kaposi's sarcoma, the symptoms of classic Kaposi's sarcoma progress very slowly over many years.\nIt's thought that people with classic Kaposi's sarcoma are born with a genetic vulnerability to the HHV-8 virus. It's most common in older men with a Mediterranean or Jewish background.\nThe condition does not affect life expectancy, so immediate treatment is not usually needed. You'll be closely monitored, and treatment may be recommended if the affected areas of skin are large and visible.\nRadiotherapy can be used to treat the affected areas of skin. Cryotherapy (freezing) or minor surgery may also be used to remove the skin lesions.  \nTransplant Kaposi's sarcoma is a rare complication of an organ transplant.\nAfter an organ transplant, you're given a medicine called an immunosuppressant to prevent your body rejecting the donated organ.\nThis weakens (suppresses) your immune system. But it can also allow a previous HHV-8 infection to reactivate and the virus to start multiplying again.\nTransplant Kaposi's sarcoma can be aggressive and needs to be treated quickly. Reducing or changing your immunosuppressant medicine can help. If this is unsuccessful, radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be needed.\nEndemic or African Kaposi's sarcoma is common in parts of Africa where the HHV-8 infection is widespread.\nIt's often caused by an undiagnosed HIV infection, and HIV medicine is the most effective treatment.\nIf this condition is not caused by an HIV infection, chemotherapy or radiotherapy may be needed."}, {"Outlook": "With the right treatment, Kaposi's sarcoma can usually be controlled for many years. Deaths from the condition are uncommon in the UK.\nThe lesions will often shrink and fade with treatment, but they may not disappear completely.\nIt may not be possible to cure Kaposi's sarcoma completely, and there's always a chance it could come back in the future.\nSee a GP or hospital specialist, or contact your local HIV clinic as soon as possible if you've had Kaposi's sarcoma in the past and you think it may have returned.\nMost people with HIV-related Kaposi's sarcoma can be successfully treated with a combination of antiretroviral therapy and chemotherapy.
