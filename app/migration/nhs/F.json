It can have a severe impact on everyday life.\nMany people with prosopagnosia are not able to recognise family members, partners or friends.\nThey may cope by using alternative strategies to recognise people, such as remembering the way they walk or their hairstyle, voice or clothing.\nBut these types of strategies do not always work \u2013 for example, when a person with prosopagnosia meets someone in an unfamiliar location."}, {"The impact of\u00a0prosopagnosia": "A person with prosopagnosia may avoid social interaction and develop social anxiety disorder, an overwhelming fear of social situations.\nThey may also have difficulty forming relationships or experience problems with their career. Feelings of depression are common.\nSome people with prosopagnosia cannot recognise certain facial expressions, judge a person's age or gender, or follow a person's gaze. \nOthers may not even recognise their own face in the mirror or in photos.\nProsopagnosia can affect a person's ability to recognise objects, such as places or cars. \nMany people also have difficulty navigating. This can involve an inability to process angles or distance, or problems remembering places and landmarks. \nFollowing the plot of films or television programmes can be almost impossible for someone with prosopagnosia because they struggle to recognise the characters.\nSomeone with prosopagnosia may worry that they appear rude or not interested when they fail to recognise a person."}, {"What causes\u00a0prosopagnosia?": "There are 2 types of prosopagnosia:\n- developmental prosopagnosia \u2013 where a person has prosopagnosia without having brain damage\n- acquired prosopagnosia \u2013 where a person develops prosopagnosia after brain damage, often following astrokeorhead injury\nIn the past, most cases of prosopagnosia were thought to occur after a brain injury (acquired prosopagnosia). \nBut research has found that many more people have prosopagnosia without having brain damage (developmental prosopagnosia) than was first thought.\nSeveral studies have indicated that as many as 1 in 50 people may have developmental prosopagnosia, which equates to about 1.5 million people in the UK.\nMost people with developmental prosopagnosia simply fail to develop the ability to recognise faces. \nSomeone born with the condition may not realise they have a problem.\nDevelopmental prosopagnosia may have a genetic component and run in families. \nMany people with the condition have reported at least 1 first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling (brother or sister), who also has problems recognising faces.\nAcquired prosopagnosia is rare. When someone acquires prosopagnosia after a brain injury, they'll quickly notice that they have lost the ability to recognise people they know.\nBut if prosopagnosia occurs after brain damage in early childhood, before the child has fully developed the ability to recognise faces, they may grow up not realising they're not able to recognise faces as well as other people can.\nHeadway has more information about the cognitive effects of brain injury.\nProsopagnosia is not related to memory problems, vision loss or learning disabilities, but it's sometimes associated with other developmental disorders, such as autism spectrum disorder, Turner syndrome and Williams syndrome."}, {"Diagnosing prosopagnosia": "If you have problems recognising faces, your GP may refer you to a clinical neuropsychologist working within the NHS or private practice. \nYou may also be referred to a researcher who specialises in the field and is based at a nearby university.\nYou'll have an assessment involving a range of tests that assess your face recognition ability, among other skills. \nFor example, you may be asked to:\n- memorise and later recognise faces you have never seen before\n- recognise famous faces\n- spot similarities and differences between faces presented next to each other\n- judge age, gender or emotional expression from a set of faces\nIf you live within travelling distance of Bournemouth University, the Centre for Face Processing Disorders may be able to offer you a formal testing session and the opportunity to take part in their research programme."}, {"Treating\u00a0prosopagnosia": "There's no specific treatment for prosopagnosia, but researchers are continuing to investigate what causes the condition, and training programmes are being developed to help improve facial recognition.\nIt's thought that compensatory strategies that help with person recognition, or techniques that attempt to restore normal face-processing mechanisms, may work for some people with either developmental or acquired prosopagnosia.\nA person's age when their brain was damaged (in the case of acquired prosopagnosia), the type and severity of the brain injury, and the timing of treatment are all thought to be important factors in how effective a rehabilitation programme will be.\nMany people with prosopagnosia develop compensatory strategies to help them recognise people, such as recognising a person's voice, clothing or the way they walk.\nBut compensatory strategies based on contextual cues do not always work, and may break down when a person with prosopagnosia meets someone they know in an unexpected location or who's changed their appearance.\nThe Centre for Face Processing Disorders has more information about coping strategies for prosopagnosia."}, {"Does my child have\u00a0prosopagnosia?": "It can be difficult to recognise prosopagnosia in children, but the following are potential signs:\n- your child frequently fails to recognise familiar people when they meet them unexpectedly\n- they're particularly clingy in public places\n- they wait for you to wave when you're collecting them from school, or approach strangers thinking they're you\n- they're socially withdrawn at school and have difficulty making friends (this may be in contrast to more confident behaviour at home, when recognition is not an issue)\n- they find it difficult to follow the plots of films or TV shows\nThe Centre for Face Processing Disorders has more information about prosopagnosia in children."}]}, {"condition": "Fainting", "sections": [{"No header": "Fainting is when you pass out for a short time.

There is separate advice on how to stop a child from choking.\nIf the airway is only partly blocked, the person will usually be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe.\nIn situations like this, a person will usually be able to clear the blockage themselves.\nIf choking is mild:\n- Encourage the person to cough to try to clear the blockage.\n- Ask them to try to spit out the object if it's in their mouth.\n- Do not put your fingers in their mouth if you can't see the object, as you risk pushing it further down their mouth.\nIf coughing doesn't work, start back blows.\nIf choking is severe, the person won't be able to speak, cry, cough or breathe, and without help they'll eventually become unconscious. If coughing doesn't work start back blows.\nTo help an adult or child over 1 year old:\n- Stand behind the person and slightly to one side. Support their chest with 1 hand. Lean the person forward so the object blocking their airway will come out of their mouth, rather than moving further down.\n- Give up to 5 sharp blows between the person's shoulder blades with the heel of your hand (the heel is between the palm of your hand and your wrist).\n- Check if the blockage has cleared.\n- If not, give up to 5 abdominal thrusts.\nDo not give abdominal thrusts to babies under 1 year old or to pregnant women.\nTo perform abdominal thrusts on a person who is severely choking and isn't in one of the above groups:\n- Stand behind the person who is choking.\n- Place your arms around their waist and bend them well forward.\n- Clench 1 fist and place it just above the person's belly button.\n- Place your other hand on top of your fist and pull sharply inwards and upwards.\n- Repeat this up to 5 times.\nThe aim is to get the obstruction out with each chest thrust, rather than necessarily doing all 5.\nIf the person's airway is still blocked after trying back blows and abdominal thrusts:\n- Call 999 and ask for an ambulance. Tell the 999 operator that the person is choking.\n- Continue with the cycles of 5 back blows and 5 abdominal thrusts until help arrives.\nThe person choking should always be seen by a healthcare professional afterwards to check for any injuries or small pieces of the obstruction that remain.\nIf someone is in difficulty in water, don't enter the water unless it's safe to do so. Don't put yourself at risk.\nOnce the person is on land, you need to check if they're breathing.

If you're in any doubt, treat the injury as a broken bone.\nIf the person is unconscious or is bleeding heavily, these must be dealt with first by controlling the bleeding with direct pressure and performing CPR. See the section on bleeding heavily above.\nIf the person is conscious, prevent any further pain or damage by keeping the fracture as still as possible until you get them safely to hospital.\nOnce you have done this, decide whether the best way to get them to hospital is by ambulance or car.\nIf the pain isn't too severe, you could transport them to hospital by car.

If possible, place cushions behind them or under their knees.\nIf they're conscious, reassure them and ask them to take a 300mg aspirin tablet to chew slowly, (unless you know they shouldn't take aspirin, for example if they are under 16 or they say they are allergic to it).\nIf the person has any medication for angina, help them to take it.\nMonitor their vital signs, such as their breathing, until help arrives.\nIf the person deteriorates and becomes unconscious, open their airway, check their breathing and, if necessary, start CPR.\nCall 999 to tell them you think the person is now in cardiac arrest (their heart has stopped beating).\nPoisoning is potentially life threatening.\nCommon causes of poisoning include:\n- swallowing a toxic substance, such as bleach\n- taking an overdose of a prescription medicine\n- eating something, like wild plants and fungi\nAlcohol poisoning can cause similar symptoms.\nIf you think someone has swallowed a poisonous substance, call 999 to get immediate medical help and advice.\nThe effects of poisoning depend on the substance swallowed, but can include vomiting, loss of consciousness, pain or a burning sensation.\nThe following advice is important:\n- Find out what's been swallowed so you can tell the paramedic or doctor.\n- Do not give the person anything to eat or drink unless a healthcare professional advises you to.\n- Do not try to cause vomiting.\n- Stay with the person, as their condition may get worse and they could become unconscious.\nIf the person becomes unconscious while you're waiting for help to arrive, check for breathing and, if necessary, perform CPR.\nDo not perform mouth-to-mouth resuscitation if the person's mouth or airway is contaminated with the poison.\nDo not leave them if they're unconscious: they could vomit. The vomit could then enter their lungs and make them choke.\nIf they do vomit naturally, try to collect some of it for the ambulance crew \u2013 this may help identify the cause of the poisoning.\nIf the patient is conscious and breathing normally, put them into the recovery position and keep checking they're breathing normally.\nFind out more about treatment for poisoning and alcohol poisoning.\nIn the case of a serious injury or illness, it's important to look out for signs of shock.\nShock is a life-threatening condition that occurs when the circulatory system fails to provide enough oxygenated blood to the body and, as a result, deprives the vital organs of oxygen.\nThis is usually the result of severe blood loss, but it can also occur after severe burns, severe vomiting, a heart attack, a bacterial infection, or a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis).\nThe type of shock described here isn't the same as the emotional response of feeling shocked, which can also occur after an accident.\nSigns of shock include:\n- pale, cold, clammy skin\n- sweating\n- rapid, shallow breathing\n- weakness and dizziness\n- feeling sick and possibly vomiting\n- thirst\n- yawning\n- sighing\nSeek medical help immediately if you notice that someone has any of these signs of shock.\nYou should:\n- call 999 as soon as possible and ask for an ambulance\n- treat any obvious injuries\n- lie the person down if their injuries allow you to and, if possible, raise and support their legs\n- use a coat or blanket to keep them warm\n- do not give them anything to eat or drink\n- give them lots of comfort and reassurance\n- monitor the person \u2013 if they stop breathing, startCPRand call 999 to update them\nThe FAST guide is the most important thing to remember when dealing with people who have had a stroke.\nThe earlier they receive treatment, the better.

A straightforward febrile seizure like this will only happen once during your child's illness.\nOccasionally, febrile seizures can last longer than 15 minutes and symptoms may only affect one area of your child's body.\nThese are known as complex febrile seizures.

It's unlikely that a doctor will see the seizure happening, so it's useful to note:\n- how long the seizure lasted\n- what happened, such as body stiffening, twitching of the face, arms and legs, staring, and loss of consciousness\n- whether your child recovered within 1 hour\n- whether they've had a seizure before\nFurther tests, such as a blood test or urine test, may be needed if the cause of your child's illness is not clear.\nIt can sometimes be difficult to get a urine sample from young children, so it may have to be done in hospital.\nFurther testing and observation in hospital is also usually recommended if your child's symptoms are unusual or they're having complex febrile seizures, particularly if they're younger than 12 months old.\nThe tests that may be recommended include:\n- anelectroencephalogram (EEG), which measures your child's electrical brain activity by placing electrodes on their scalp. Unusual patterns of brain activity can sometimes indicateepilepsy.\n- alumbar puncture, where a small sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed from the spine for testing.

The process involves painting a varnish containing high levels of fluoride onto the surface of the tooth every 6 months to prevent decay. It works by strengthening tooth enamel, making it more resistant to decay.\nFrom the age of 3, children should be offered fluoride varnish treatment at least twice a year.

The first substantive UK scheme was established in Birmingham in 1964.\nAround 5.8 million people in England receive fluoridated water. This means fluoride has been added to bring it up to around 1mg of fluoride per litre of water, which is a level found to reduce tooth decay levels.\nThe decision about whether to add fluoride to the water supply is made by individual local authorities. Areas where water fluoridation schemes are currently in place include parts of:\n- the West Midlands\n- the North East\n- the East Midlands\n- Eastern England\n- the North West\n- Yorkshire and Humber\nIn some parts of the country, such as parts of the North East and Midlands, the public water supply naturally contains a level of fluoride that's similar to that seen in schemes. Some private water supplies contain more than this amount.\nYour local water supplier should be able to tell you how much fluoride is in your water supply and whether any is added. Most companies have an online facility where you can use your postcode to check the water in your area.\nOver the past 50 years, there have been several reviews of the safety and effectiveness of water fluoridation schemes.\nRecent large reviews that have been carried out include:\n- NHS Centre for Reviews and Dissemination: A systematic review of water fluoridation (PDF, 6.22Mb)\u2013 in 2000\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US): Recommendations on selected interventions to prevent dental caries, oral and pharyngeal cancers and sports-related craniofacial injuries (PDF, 69kb)\u2013 in 2002\n- US Department of Health and Human Services Community Preventive Services Task Force: Community water fluoridation\u2013 in 2013\n- Royal Society of New Zealand: Health effects of water fluoridation (PDF, 1Mb)\u2013 in 2014\n- Cochrane Oral Health Group: Water fluoridation for the prevention of dental caries\u2013 in 2015\nOverall, these reviews found that water fluoridation appears to contribute to reduced tooth decay levels and doesn't seem to be associated with any significant health risks."}, {"Is fluoride safe?": "There have been some concerns that fluoride may be linked to a variety of health conditions.

The rewarming process is often painful, and regular strong painkillers may be needed.\nIt's important not to rewarm the affected area if there's a chance of it freezing again, as this can lead to further tissue damage.\nIf frostbite is severe, the loss of blood supply to the tissue may cause it to die (gangrene). A type of surgery called debridement may be needed to remove the dead tissue. Amputation may be needed if frostbite is severe.\nRead more about treating frostbite."}, {"What causes frostbite?": "The body responds to cold temperatures by narrowing the blood vessels. Blood flow to the extremities slows down so flow to the vital organs can be increased.\nAs the blood is redirected away from the extremities, these parts of the body get colder, and fluid in the tissue can freeze into ice crystals.\nThe ice crystals can cause severe cell and tissue damage in the affected area. The low blood flow also deprives the tissues of oxygen. If blood flow can't be restored, the tissue will eventually die.\nCertain groups of people are at greater risk of getting frostbite.\nThey include:\n- people who take part in winter and high-altitude sports, such as mountaineers and skiers\n- anyone stranded in extreme cold weather conditions\n- anyone who works outdoors in harsh conditions for long periods of time, such as soldiers, sailors and rescue workers\n- homeless people\n- the very young and very old, as their bodies are less able to regulate body temperature\n- people with conditions that cause blood vessel damage or circulation problems, such asdiabetesandRaynaud's phenomenon\n- anyone taking medicine that constricts the blood vessels, includingbeta blockers\u2013 smoking can also constrict the blood vessels\nPeople who've taken drugs or drunk alcohol are also vulnerable to frostbite. Taking drugs or being drunk can lead to risky behaviour, not responding normally to cold, or falling asleep outside in cold weather.\nAs you'd expect, cases of frostbite in England often rise during particularly cold winters. For example, during the very cold winter of 2010-11, there were 111 hospital admissions for frostbite. In most years, there are around 30 to 60 cases every winter."}, {"Preventing frostbite": "Most of the time frostbite can be prevented by taking precautions during cold weather.\nAvoid unnecessary exposure to cold temperatures. The combination of wind and cold temperatures (wind chill) can also cause a rapid drop in temperature, so avoid going out when it's cold and windy, if possible. \nIt's also important to know what the early symptoms of frostbite are, particularly the tingling sensation of frostnip.\nWear appropriate clothing that protects your extremities, such as:\n- well-insulated boots and a thick pair of well-fitting socks\n- mittens \u2013 they provide better protection against very cold weather than gloves\n- a warm, weatherproof hat that covers your ears \u2013 it's important to protect your head from the cold\n- multiple thin layers of warm, loose-fitting clothing \u2013 these act as insulation\nYou should also try to keep dry and remove any wet clothing as soon as you can. \nIf you're travelling during cold weather, plan for emergencies. For example, if you're driving in icy conditions, make sure you keep a warm blanket and some spare clothes in the boot of your car in case you break down. \nIf you're travelling by foot, always let others know where you're going and what time you'll be back. Take a fully charged mobile phone with you so you can call for help if you have an accident, such as a fall.\nBe careful when drinking alcohol during very cold weather. Drinking too much increases your risk of falling asleep in the cold, a common cause of frostbite. Alcohol also causes you to lose heat at a faster rate.\nSmoking also makes you more vulnerable to the effects of the cold because nicotine can narrow your blood vessels."}, {"Complications of frostbite": "If some of your tissue dies, the dead tissue will no longer have a blood supply.
